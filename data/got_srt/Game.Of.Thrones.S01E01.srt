1
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,243
Easy, boy.

2
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,277
What do you expect?
They're savages.

3
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,779
One lot steals a goat from another lot,

4
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,240
before you know it
they're ripping each other to pieces.

5
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,826
I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.

6
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,120
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

7
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,414
How close did you get?

8
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,959
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the Wall.

9
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,046
Do the dead frighten you?

10
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,299
Our orders were to track the wildlings.

11
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:39,635
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

12
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,179
You don't think he'll ask us how they died?

13
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,225
Get back on your horse.

14
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,441
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

15
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,151
They even killed the children.

16
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,112
It's a good thing we're not children.

17
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,283
You want to run away south,
run away.

18
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,328
Of course,
they will behead you as a deserter.

19
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,580
If I don't catch you first.

20
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,251
Get back on your horse.

21
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,712
I won't say it again.

22
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,329
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

23
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,706
They were here.

24
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,753
See where they went.

25
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,135
What is it?

26
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:46,554
It's...

27
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,091
Go on, Father's watching.

28
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,011
And your mother.

29
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,521
Fine work, as always.
Well done.

30
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,314
Thank you.

31
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,277
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

32
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,195
Quite beautiful.

33
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,197
The stitching...

34
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,533
Oh, no, no, no. This stitch is very...

35
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,203
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

36
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,138
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

37
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,682
Keep practicing, Bran.

38
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,811
Go on.

39
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,605
Don't think too much, Bran.

40
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,192
Relax your bow arm.

41
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,832
- Quick, Bran!
- Faster.

42
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,419
Lord Stark!

43
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,505
My lady.

44
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,759
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.

45
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,887
They've captured a deserter
from the Night's Watch.

46
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,309
Get the lads to saddle their horses.

47
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,394
Do you have to?

48
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,605
He swore an oath, Cat.

49
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,732
Law is law, my lady.

50
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,818
Tell Bran he's coming too.

51
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,322
Ned.

52
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,741
10 is too young
to see such things.

53
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,409
He won't be a boy forever.

54
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,080
And winter is coming.

55
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,434
Good lad, go run back and get the rest.

56
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,150
White walkers.

57
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,986
I saw the white walkers.

58
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,988
White walkers.

59
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,158
The white walkers, I saw them.

60
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,585
I know I broke my oath.

61
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,296
And I know I'm a deserter.

62
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,842
I should have gone back to the Wall
and warned them, but...

63
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,011
I saw what I saw.

64
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,680
I saw the white walkers.

65
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,475
People need to know.

66
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,479
If you can get word to my family...

67
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,898
tell them I'm no coward.

68
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,984
Tell them I'm sorry.

69
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:15,669
Forgive me, Lord.

70
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,217
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

71
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,303
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

72
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,264
- ...King of the Andals and the First Men...
- Father will know if you do.

73
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,726
...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

74
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,729
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

75
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,398
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North,

76
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,984
sentence you to die.

77
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,459
You did well.

78
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,113
You understand why I did it?

79
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,115
Jon said he was a deserter.

80
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,785
But do you understand
why I had to kill him?

81
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,537
"Our way is the old way"?

82
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,833
The man who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

83
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,254
Is it true he saw the white walkers?

84
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,259
The white walkers have been gone
for thousands of years.

85
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,928
So he was lying?

86
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,768
A madman sees what he sees.

87
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,629
What is it?

88
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,675
Mountain lion?

89
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,387
There are no mountain lions
in these woods.

90
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,352
It's a freak.

91
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,021
It's a direwolf.

92
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,532
Tough old beast.

93
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,912
There are no direwolves
south of the Wall.

94
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,081
Now there are 5

95
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,376
You want to hold it?

96
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,423
Where will they go?

97
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,258
Their mother's dead.

98
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,927
They don't belong down here.

99
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,847
Better a quick death.
They won't last without their mother.

100
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,974
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

101
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,768
Put away your blade.

102
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,813
- I take orders from your father, not you.
- Please, Father!

103
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,731
I'm sorry, Bran.

104
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,899
Lord Stark?

105
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,194
There are 5 pups.

106
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,656
One for each of the Stark children.

107
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,283
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.

108
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,870
They were meant to have them.

109
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,294
You will train them yourselves.

110
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,296
You will feed them yourselves.

111
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:31,299
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

112
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,643
What about you?

113
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,187
I'm not a Stark.

114
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,398
Get on.

115
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,909
What is it?

116
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,625
The runt of the litter.
That one's yours, Snow.

117
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,980
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you...

118
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,234
you worry too much.

119
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,695
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

120
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,909
When we were 7 and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

121
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:25,413
100-foot drop into the water...
you were never afraid.

122
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,166
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told Father.

123
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,878
"We're Lannisters.
Lannisters don't act like fools."

124
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,843
- What if Jon Arryn told someone?
- But who would he tell?

125
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,345
My husband.

126
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,224
If he told the king, both our heads would be
skewered on the city gates by now.

127
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,895
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know,
it died with him.

128
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,606
And Robert will choose
a new Hand of the King,

129
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,318
someone to do his job while he's off
fucking boars and hunting whores.

130
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,112
Or is it the other way around?

131
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,991
And life will go on.

132
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,702
You should be the Hand of the King.

133
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,413
That's an honor I can do without.

134
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,164
Their days are too long,

135
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,958
their lives are too short.

136
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,707
All these years,

137
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:53,960
and I still feel like an outsider
when I come here.

138
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,464
You have 5 northern children.

139
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:01,009
You're not an outsider.

140
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,637
I wonder if the old gods agree.

141
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,765
It's your gods with all the rules.

142
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,857
I am so sorry, my love.

143
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,612
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

144
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,282
Jon Arryn is dead.

145
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,910
A fever took him.

146
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,957
I know he was like a father to you.

147
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:38,129
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

148
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,256
gods be good.

149
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,851
The raven brought more news.

150
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,356
The king rides for Winterfell...

151
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,193
with the queen and all the rest of them.

152
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,446
If he's coming this far north...

153
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:07,033
there's only one thing he's after.

154
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,537
You can always say no, Ned.

155
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,590
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

156
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,469
- I'm told he reads all night.
- I'm told he drinks all night.

157
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,764
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

158
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,433
stature?

159
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,436
We've brought up 8 barrels of ale
from the cellar.

160
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,770
Perhaps we'll find out.

161
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,731
In any case, candles.

162
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,781
Why is your mother so dead set on us
getting pretty for the king?

163
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,659
It's for the queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

164
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,828
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

165
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,415
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab
with his right royal prick.

166
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,461
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.

167
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,880
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

168
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,544
Gods, but they grow fast.

169
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,507
Brandon!

170
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,635
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

171
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,846
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.

172
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,933
But he's coming right now, down our road.

173
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,359
I want you to promise me,

174
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,152
no more climbing.

175
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,158
I promise.

176
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,372
- Do you know what?
- What?

177
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:19,707
You always look at your feet
before you lie.

178
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,628
Run and find your father.

179
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,797
Tell him the king is close.

180
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,595
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

181
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,065
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Oh.

182
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,109
What are you doing with that on?

183
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,614
Go on.

184
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,658
Move!

185
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,659
Your Grace.

186
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,832
You've got fat.

187
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,470
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

188
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,061
9 years... Why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

189
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,732
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.

190
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,196
- Where's the Imp?
- Will you shut up?

191
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,823
Who have we here?

192
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,534
You must be Robb.

193
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,622
My, you're a pretty one.

194
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,917
Your name is?

195
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,419
Arya.

196
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,214
Oh, show us your muscles.

197
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,843
You'll be a soldier.

198
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,140
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

199
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,392
Would you please shut up?

200
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,822
My queen.

201
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,949
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

202
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:23,910
We've been riding for a month, my love.

203
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,037
Surely the dead can wait.

204
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,039
Ned.

205
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,925
Where's the Imp?

206
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,430
Where is our brother?

207
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,307
Go and find the little beast.

208
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,353
Tell me about Jon Arryn.

209
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,815
One minute he was fine and then...

210
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:57,777
burned right through him,
whatever it was.

211
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,947
I loved that man.

212
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,407
We both did.

213
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:06,869
He never had to teach you much,
but me? You remember me at 16?

214
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,830
All I wanted to do

215
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,582
was crack skulls and fuck girls.

216
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,836
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

217
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,588
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

218
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,178
I need you, Ned,

219
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,974
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

220
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,644
Lord Eddard Stark...

221
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,064
I would name you the Hand of the King.

222
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,654
I'm not worthy of the honor.

223
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,197
I'm not trying to honor you.

224
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,032
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

225
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,870
while I eat, drink and whore my way
to an early grave.

226
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,830
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

227
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,333
You helped me win the Iron Throne,

228
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,170
now help me keep the damn thing.

229
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,672
We were meant to rule together.

230
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,634
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

231
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,179
Well, it's not too late.

232
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,515
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

233
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,019
We'll join our houses.

234
00:30:38,212 --> 00:30:41,172
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

235
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,724
Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

236
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,476
I did hear something about that.

237
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,770
And the queen and her twin brother.

238
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:58,940
They say that he is the most handsome man
in the Seven Kingdoms.

239
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:00,942
And the other brother?

240
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:04,278
- The queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one...

241
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,198
and there's the clever one.

242
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,992
Mmm...

243
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
I hear they call him the Imp.

244
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,288
I hear he hates that nickname.

245
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:17,792
Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.

246
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,169
I hear he's a drunken little lecher,

247
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,755
prone to all manner of perversions.

248
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,674
Clever girl.

249
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,261
We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

250
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:31,180
Have you?

251
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,682
- Already?
- Oh!

252
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,312
The gods gave me one blessing.

253
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,695
- Don't get up.
- My lord.

254
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,490
Should I explain to you the meaning of
a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

255
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,659
You have much to teach me, no doubt,

256
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:54,954
but our sister craves your attention.

257
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,665
She has odd cravings, our sister.

258
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,834
A family trait.

259
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,420
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.

260
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,383
- Don't leave me alone with these people.
- I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.

261
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,845
And this is the first of many courses.

262
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,180
I thought you might say that.

263
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,933
But since we're short on time...

264
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,351
Come on, girls.

265
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,109
See you at sundown.

266
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,320
Close the door!

267
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,501
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

268
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,589
She should be on a hill somewhere

269
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:49,050
with the sun and the clouds above her.

270
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,218
She was my sister.

271
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,012
This is where she belongs.

272
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,515
She belonged with me.

273
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,191
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

274
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:11,030
It's done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.

275
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,160
Not all of them.

276
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,048
Daenerys!

277
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,928
Daenerys.

278
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,055
There's our bride-to-be.

279
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,642
Look, a gift from Illyrio.

280
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,812
Touch it.

281
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:45,147
Go on, feel the fabric.

282
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,070
Mmm.

283
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,074
Isn't he a gracious host?

284
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:02,123
We've been his guests for over a year
and he's never asked us for anything.

285
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,125
Illyrio's no fool.

286
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,043
He knows I won't forget my friends

287
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,421
when I come into my throne.

288
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,510
You still slouch.

289
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,183
Let them see.

290
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,731
You have a woman's body now.

291
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,625
I need you to be perfect today.

292
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,546
Can you do that for me?

293
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,677
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

294
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,680
No.

295
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,398
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

296
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,484
they will say it began today.

297
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,884
It's too hot, my lady.

298
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,074
Where is he?

299
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,077
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

300
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:20,427
Respect to one that is respectful, great Khal

301
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,471
May I present my honored guests?

302
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,141
Viserys of House Targaryen,

303
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,768
the third of his name,

304
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,272
the rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

305
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,690
and his sister,

306
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,693
Daenerys of House Targaryen.

307
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,612
<i>Azha anhaan asshilat...</i>

308
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,156
Do you see how long his hair is?

309
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:44,076
When Dothraki are defeated in combat

310
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,788
they cut off their braid
so the whole world can see their shame.

311
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:51,750
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.

312
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,089
He's a savage, of course,
but he's one of the finest killers alive.

313
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,593
And you will be his queen.

314
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,262
Come forward, my dear.

315
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,511
Where is he going?

316
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:47,348
- The ceremony is over.
- But he... But he didn't say anything.

317
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,599
Did he like her?

318
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:52,478
Trust me, Your Grace,
if he didn't like her, we'd know.

319
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,858
It won't be long now.

320
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:01,612
Soon you will cross the narrow sea
and take back your father's throne.

321
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:06,700
The people drink secret toasts
to your health.

322
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:09,286
They cry out for their true king.

323
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,708
When will they be married?

324
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,379
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

325
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,756
Is it true they lie with their horses?

326
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,801
I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

327
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,053
Do you take me for a fool?

328
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,888
I take you for a king.

329
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,141
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

330
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,977
My apologies if I've given offense.

331
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,688
I know how to play a man like Drogo.

332
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,607
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

333
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:41,568
I don't want to be his queen.

334
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,033
I want to go home.

335
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,035
So do I.

336
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,497
I want us both to go home,

337
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,833
but they took it from us.

338
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,751
So tell me, sweet sister,

339
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,545
how do we go home?

340
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,424
I don't know.

341
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,801
We go home with an army.

342
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,180
With Khal Drogo's army.

343
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,393
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,

344
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,604
all 40,000 men and their horses too,

345
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:19,398
if that's what it took.

346
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:39,209
Do you think Joffrey will like me?

347
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,545
What if he thinks I'm ugly?

348
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:45,090
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

349
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,094
He's so handsome.

350
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,973
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

351
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,185
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

352
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,978
Why would he say no?

353
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,023
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

354
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,192
He'd have to leave home.

355
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,862
He'd have to leave me.

356
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,990
And so would you.

357
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,451
You left your home to come here.

358
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,328
And I'd be queen someday.

359
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,831
Please make Father say yes!

360
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,750
- Sansa...
- Please, please!

361
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,753
It's the only thing I ever wanted.

362
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,811
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

363
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,979
Come on!

364
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,857
Come here, you little beauty!

365
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,958
Is he dead yet?

366
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,506
Uncle Benjen.

367
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,718
You got bigger.

368
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,680
Rode all day.

369
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,391
Didn't want to leave you alone
with the Lannisters.

370
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,851
Why aren't you at the feast?

371
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,728
Lady Stark thought it might
insult the royal family

372
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,772
to seat a bastard in their midst.

373
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,984
Well, you're always
welcome on the Wall.

374
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,069
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

375
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,904
So take me with you
when you go back.

376
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,907
- Jon...
- Father will let me if you ask him.

377
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,826
I know he will.

378
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,622
The Wall isn't going anywhere.

379
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,417
I'm ready to swear your oath.

380
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,670
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

381
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,714
We have no families.

382
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,551
- None of us will ever father sons.
- I don't care about that.

383
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,637
You might, if you knew what it meant.

384
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,476
I'd better get inside,

385
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,896
rescue your father from his guests.

386
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,984
We'll talk later.

387
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,745
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

388
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,042
What are you doing back there?

389
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,377
Preparing for a night with your family.

390
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,509
I've always wanted to see the Wall.

391
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,428
You're Tyrion Lannister,

392
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,096
the queen's brother?

393
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:39,890
My greatest accomplishment.

394
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,102
And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard,
aren't you?

395
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,733
Did I offend you? Sorry.

396
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,321
You are the bastard, though.

397
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,950
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

398
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,828
And Lady Stark is not your mother,

399
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,957
making you... the bastard.

400
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:09,086
Let me give you some advice, bastard.

401
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,047
Never forget what you are.

402
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,508
The rest of the world will not.

403
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,218
Wear it like armor...

404
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,304
and it can never be used to hurt you.

405
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,642
What the hell do you know
about being a bastard?

406
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,563
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

407
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,878
You at a feast...

408
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,506
it's like a bear in a trap.

409
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,093
The boy I beheaded...

410
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:02,347
- did you know him?
- Of course I did. Just a lad.

411
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,600
But he was tough, Ned,

412
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:06,977
a true ranger.

413
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,480
He was talking madness.

414
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,442
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.

415
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,861
The two he was with are still missing.

416
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,991
Hmph. A wildling ambush.

417
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,076
Maybe.

418
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,913
Direwolves south of the Wall,

419
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,249
talk of the walkers,

420
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,918
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

421
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:38,383
Winter is coming.

422
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,888
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

423
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,473
- How are you?
- I'm good.

424
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,687
Is this your first time
in the North, Your Grace?

425
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,565
Yes. Lovely country.

426
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,697
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

427
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:06,370
I remember how scared I was when
Ned brought me up here for the first time.

428
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,165
Hello, little dove.

429
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,335
But you are a beauty.

430
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,754
- How old are you?
- 13, Your Grace.

431
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,465
You're tall. Still growing?

432
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,425
I think so, Your Grace.

433
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,677
And have you bled yet?

434
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,267
No, Your Grace.

435
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,396
Your dress, did you make it?

436
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,442
Such talent.
You must make something for me.

437
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,406
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

438
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,616
I hear the same.

439
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,952
Your daughter will do well in the capital.

440
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:50,414
Such a beauty shouldn't stay
hidden up here forever.

441
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,058
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

442
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,645
- I hope it's true.
- Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

443
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,982
I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate
your new title, if you accept.

444
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,192
It would be good
to have you on the field.

445
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,695
The competition has become a bit stale.

446
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:24,072
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

447
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,740
Getting a little old for it?

448
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,744
I don't fight in tournaments

449
00:46:29,871 --> 00:46:32,247
because when I fight a man for real,

450
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,124
I don't want him to know what I can do.

451
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,794
Well said.

452
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,505
Arya!

453
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,551
It's not funny!

454
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:47,304
She always does this.

455
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,848
This was my favorite dress
and she ruined it.

456
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,434
She always does it
and it's not funny!

457
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,394
Time for bed.

458
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,157
I'm a Northman.

459
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:13,371
I belong here with you, not down south
in that rats nest they call a capital.

460
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,167
I won't let him take you.

461
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,296
The king takes what he wants.

462
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,715
That's why he's king.

463
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,428
I'll say, "Listen, fat man."

464
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,849
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

465
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,893
"He belongs to me now."

466
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,690
How did he get so fat?

467
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:45,111
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

468
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:49,157
It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

469
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,536
Send him in.

470
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,165
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

471
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,793
A rider in the night...

472
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,087
from your sister.

473
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,430
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

474
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,689
What's she doing at the Eyrie?

475
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,358
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

476
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,702
What news?

477
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,789
She's fled the capital.

478
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:42,669
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.

479
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,671
By the Lannisters.

480
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,465
She says the king is in danger.

481
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,843
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

482
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,595
She doesn't know what she's saying.

483
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:57,017
Lysa's head would be on a spike right now
if the wrong people had found that letter.

484
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:59,311
Do you think she would risk her life,

485
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:01,021
her son's life,

486
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,524
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

487
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:13,617
If this news is true...

488
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,287
and the Lannisters conspire
against the throne,

489
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,831
who but you can protect the king?

490
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,208
They murdered the last Hand.

491
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,544
Now you want Ned to take the job?

492
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,548
The king rode for a month
to ask for Lord Stark's help.

493
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,176
He's the only one he trusts.

494
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:35,513
You swore the king an oath, my lord.

495
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,225
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

496
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:41,353
He owes him nothing.

497
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:46,483
Your father and brother
rode south once

498
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:49,235
on a king's demand.

499
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,281
A different time.

500
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,743
A different king.

501
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:01,433
When do I meet with the Khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.

502
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,978
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,
you shall have it.

503
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:08,148
- When?
- When their omens favor war.

504
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,818
I piss on Dothraki omens.

505
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,612
I've waited 17 years to get my throne back.

506
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,360
Iteo Akkah

507
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:19,511
A Dothraki wedding without at least
3 deaths is considered a dull affair.

508
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:37,152
- Come, Jorah the Andal
- Great khal.

509
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,911
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.

510
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,456
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.

511
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,543
Thank you, ser.

512
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,922
Are you from my country?

513
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:58,091
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.

514
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,927
I served your father for many years.

515
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,013
Gods be good, I hope to
always serve the rightful king.

516
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:29,914
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

517
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,792
from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.

518
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,837
The ages have turned them to stone,

519
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:37,922
but they will always be beautiful.

520
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,843
Thank you, Magister.

521
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,580
She's beautiful.

522
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,086
Ser Jorah, I...

523
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,964
I don't know how to say "thank you"
in Dothraki.

524
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,883
There is no word for "thank you"
in Dothraki.

525
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:27,031
Make him happy.

526
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,426
No.

527
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,598
Do you know the common tongue?

528
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,146
No.

529
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,611
Is "no" the only word that you know?

530
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:49,447
No.

531
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,852
Rough night, Imp?

532
00:57:19,978 --> 00:57:21,938
If I get through this without squirting

533
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,941
from one end or the other,
it'll be a miracle.

534
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,859
I didn't pick you for a hunter.

535
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:30,071
The greatest in the land
my spear never misses.

536
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,116
It's not hunting if you pay for it.

537
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,210
Are you as good with a spear
as you used to be?

538
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:46,796
No, but I'm still better than you.

539
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,425
I know what I'm putting you through.

540
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:53,219
Thank you for saying yes.

541
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:57,640
I only ask you because I need you.

542
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:01,394
You're a loyal friend. You hear me?

543
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,063
A loyal friend.

544
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,857
The last one I've got.

545
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,777
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

546
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,282
And I'll make sure you don't look
so fucking grim all the time.

547
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,869
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

548
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,589
Come on, you.

549
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,751
Stop! Stop.

550
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,883
Are you completely mad?

551
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,511
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

552
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:00,680
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

553
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,932
I heard you the first time.

554
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,355
Quite the little climber, aren't you?

555
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:13,442
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

556
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:15,152
10.

557
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:26,330
The things I do for love.

1
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,144
Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

2
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,771
No.

3
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,816
l stood vigil
for him myself last night.

4
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,819
He had no one else.

5
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,782
He'd never worn this armour before.

6
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:40,827
Bad luck for him
going against the Mountain.

7
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,121
Who determines the draw?

8
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,374
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

9
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,292
Aye.

10
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,628
But who holds the straws?

11
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:53,882
You've done good work, Sisters.

12
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,597
Life is strange.

13
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,142
Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

14
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,187
l'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

15
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,524
As is my wife. l don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

16
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,860
You're too modest.

17
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,487
l've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

18
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:19,157
My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

19
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,202
l never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.

20
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:24,329
He was a fine man, your father.

21
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,541
What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.

22
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,251
And that lad

23
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,378
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

24
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,506
How could he afford a new suit of armour?

25
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,967
Perhaps Lord Arryn
Ieft him some money?

26
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,431
- l hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

27
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,267
Robert tends
to do what he wants.

28
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,895
lf the king got what
he wanted all the time,

29
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,522
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

30
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,572
lt's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

31
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,408
Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.

32
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,535
Did you know that?

33
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:09,082
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

34
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,002
He can't even put
a man's armour on him properly.

35
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,963
- You're too fat for your armour.
- Fat?

36
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,549
Fat, is it?

37
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,052
ls that how you speak to your king?

38
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,061
Oh, it's funny, is it?

39
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,024
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

40
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,527
You don't like the Hand's joke?

41
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,946
You're torturing the poor boy.

42
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,740
You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armour.

43
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,785
Go find the breastplate
stretcher now!

44
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,123
''The breastplate stretcher''?

45
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,334
How long before he figures it out?

46
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,629
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.

47
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,715
You watch me out there.
l still know how to point a lance.

48
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,468
You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

49
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,930
Why, because l'm king?
Piss on that. l want to hit somebody!

50
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,182
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

51
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,185
- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.

52
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,690
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.

53
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,150
Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?

54
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,944
Aye.

55
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,743
- Drink.
- l'm not thirsty.

56
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,246
Drink. Your king commands it.

57
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,043
Gods,

58
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,629
too fat for my armour.

59
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,175
Your squire
a Lannister boy?

60
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,760
Mm. A bloody idiot,

61
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,846
but Cersei insisted.

62
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,349
l have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

63
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,352
''Cersei Lannister will make
a good match,'' he told me.

64
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,147
''You'll need her father on your side.''

65
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:01,111
l thought being king
meant l could do whatever l wanted.

66
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,241
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

67
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,036
At least l can smell
someone else's blood.

68
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,163
- Robert.
- What?

69
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,875
Oh.

70
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,586
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

71
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,547
Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!

72
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:37,606
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

73
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,070
The Knight of the Flowers.

74
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,161
Thank you, Ser Loras.

75
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,945
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

76
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,739
- Hey.
- l can't watch.

77
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,786
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

78
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:36,623
- l'll take that bet.
- Now what will l buy with 100 gold dragons?

79
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,792
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

80
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:41,920
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

81
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,924
- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.

82
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,885
Ser Loras rides well.

83
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,167
Such a shame, Littlefinger.

84
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,504
lt would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

85
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,506
And tell me, Lord Renly,

86
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,966
when will you be having your friend?

87
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:42,231
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.

88
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,650
Ser Loras would never do that.

89
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,695
- There's no honour in tricks.
- No honour and quite a bit of gold.

90
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,950
Sword!

91
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,561
Leave him be!

92
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,710
Stop this madness
in the name of your king!

93
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,926
Let him go!

94
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,604
l owe you my life, ser.

95
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,898
l'm no ser.

96
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,131
Remove his hood.

97
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,343
<i>On that eve, the captive Imp<i>

98
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,971
<i>Downwards from his horse did limp<i>

99
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,141
<i>No more would he preen and primp<i>

100
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,851
<i>In garb of red and gold<i>

101
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,603
This isn't the Kingsroad.

102
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,565
- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- l did... Often and loudly.

103
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,236
Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,

104
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,404
looking for me in the wrong place.

105
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,449
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

106
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,077
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

107
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,372
Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.

108
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,791
Would you be so good as to untie me?

109
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,294
- And why would l do that?
- Why not?

110
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,756
Am l going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

111
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,466
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

112
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,511
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

113
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:22,349
Ah, the eastern road.

114
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,393
We're going to the Vale.

115
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,146
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

116
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:32,234
Tell me, Lady Stark,
when was the last time you saw your sister?

117
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,987
- 5 years ago.
- She's changed.

118
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,700
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

119
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,995
- l am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am l.

120
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,497
l had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.

121
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,416
- The dagger found...
- What sort of imbecile

122
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,209
arms an assassin with his own blade?

123
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,461
- Should l gag him?
- Why?

124
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,463
Am l starting to make sense?

125
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,383
Rodrik!

126
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,847
My lady, this way.

127
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,449
Untie me.

128
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:23,493
lf l die, what's the point?

129
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,209
Ah!

130
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,130
- Rodrik?
- l'll be fine, my lady.

131
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,259
There's no need to bloody yourself.

132
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,637
Your first?

133
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:26,849
You need a woman.

134
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,101
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

135
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,146
l'm willing if she is.

136
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,661
Bran.

137
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,498
The Iron Islands.
Sigil a kraken.

138
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,750
Words ''We do not sow.''

139
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,961
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

140
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,381
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

141
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,302
And failed rebellions.

142
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:09,725
Sigil a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

143
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,853
- Good.
- Words ''Ours is the fury.''

144
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,522
- Lords the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

145
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,524
The Westerlands.

146
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,735
- Sigil a lion.
- Mmm.

147
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,863
- Words ''A Lannister always pays his debts.''
- No.

148
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,366
A common saying,
but not their official motto.

149
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,493
Lords the Lannisters.

150
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,496
- We're still on their words.
- l don't know them.

151
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,540
You do know them. Think.

152
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,126
''Unbowed, unbent, unbroken.''

153
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,921
- That's House Martell.
- ''Righteous in wrath.''

154
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:42,508
- House Hornwood.
- ''Family, duty, honour.''

155
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,551
Those are Tully words
your mother's.

156
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:48,222
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honour...

157
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:50,557
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

158
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,684
Family comes first?

159
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,064
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

160
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,608
How can she protect the family

161
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,069
if she's not with her family?

162
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,405
Your mother sat by your bed

163
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,242
for 3 weeks while you slept.

164
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,452
And then she left!

165
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,207
When you were born, l was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

166
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,294
l placed you in her arms.

167
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:23,215
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

168
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:26,760
she will love you.

169
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,554
Absolutely.

170
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,724
- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?

171
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,685
l still can't tell you,

172
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,271
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

173
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,022
Today?

174
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:41,775
- No, l don't.
- Then how can you promise me

175
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,944
she'll be home soon?

176
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:49,324
Sometimes l worry
you're too smart for your own good.

177
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,870
l'll never shoot another arrow.

178
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,373
And where is that written?

179
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,126
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

180
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:01,712
lf the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

181
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,298
you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.

182
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,133
Really?

183
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,678
Dothraki boys learn
when they're 4 years old.

184
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,805
Why shouldn't you?

185
00:16:26,612 --> 00:16:28,989
Shh, keep it down.

186
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,575
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

187
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,953
l thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

188
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,372
lmportant enough for the likes of you.

189
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,792
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

190
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,379
Who, the Imp?
l'd call him half a nobleman.

191
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,423
Jealous?

192
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,300
Why should l be jealous?

193
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,345
Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

194
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,515
What's a dwarf like down below?

195
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,725
l've always wondered.

196
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,937
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

197
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,191
He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

198
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,236
Generous tipper.

199
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,030
l guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

200
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,032
You are jealous.

201
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,784
l'm a Greyjoy.

202
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,036
We've been lords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

203
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,956
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

204
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,999
not even the Lannisters.

205
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,126
And what about the Starks?

206
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,381
l've been Lord Stark's ward
since l was 8 years old.

207
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,884
A ward
that's a nice word for it.

208
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,846
Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...

209
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:37,140
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

210
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,894
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

211
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,564
You're a very serious boy.

212
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,817
- l'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

213
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:51,822
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

214
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,283
l don't want to pay for it.

215
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:57,035
Then get yourself a wife.

216
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,583
Come on.

217
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,170
l'm not gonna hurt you.

218
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,846
How is your son, my lord?

219
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,724
He'll never walk again.

220
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:22,728
But his mind is sound?

221
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,689
So they say.

222
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,900
A blessing, then.

223
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:32,196
l suffered an early mutilation myself.

224
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,617
Some doors close forever...

225
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,871
others open
in most unexpected places.

226
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,790
May l?

227
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,256
lf the wrong ears heard
what l'm about to tell you,

228
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,509
off comes my head.

229
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,178
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

230
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,932
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

231
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,476
But there are things you must know.

232
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,938
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool

233
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:10,859
your friend, l know, but a fool
and doomed unless you save him.

234
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,487
l've been in the capital a month.

235
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,366
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

236
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,243
l didn't trust you.

237
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:21,745
So why do you trust me now?

238
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,667
The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

239
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,919
There are few men of honour
in the capital.

240
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,754
You are one of them.

241
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,800
l would like to believe l am another
strange as that may seem.

242
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,469
What sort of doom does the king face?

243
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,305
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

244
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:44,393
The tears of lys, they call it.

245
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,854
A rare and costly thing,

246
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,440
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

247
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,535
Who gave it to him?

248
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,746
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

249
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,084
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

250
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,336
There was one boy.

251
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,006
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

252
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,092
The squire, Ser Hugh?

253
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,096
Pity, what happened to him,

254
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,349
just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.

255
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,562
lf Ser Hugh poisoned him...

256
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,107
who paid Ser Hugh?

257
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,571
- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

258
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:41,158
He was Hand for 17 years
17 good years.

259
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,160
Why kill him?

260
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:47,372
He started asking questions.

261
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,695
He's found
one bastard already.

262
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,989
He has the book.

263
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,033
The rest will come.

264
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,452
And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

265
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,287
The gods alone know.

266
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,415
The fools tried to kill his son.

267
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,252
What's worse
they botched it.

268
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,465
The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

269
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,344
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- What good is war now?

270
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,471
We're not ready.

271
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,182
lf one Hand can die,
why not a second?

272
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,893
This Hand is not the other.

273
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,520
We need time.

274
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,815
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

275
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,318
- You know what these savages are.
- ''Delay,'' you say.

276
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,404
''Move fast,'' l reply.

277
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,782
This is no longer
a game for 2 players.

278
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,951
It never was.

279
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:28,515
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

280
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,186
l admire your industry.

281
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,897
You do move quietly.

282
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,524
We all have our qualities.

283
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:40,527
You look a bit lonely today.

284
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,030
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

285
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,574
- First boy is on the house.
- l think you're mistaking

286
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,577
- business with pleasure.
- Am l?

287
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,374
All those birds that whisper in your ear
such pretty little things.

288
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,920
Trust me,

289
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,672
we accommodate all inclinations.

290
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,802
Oh, l'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, l hear.

291
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:10,724
l'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion
both equally important.

292
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:15,521
Though l suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

293
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:20,067
ls it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

294
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:22,903
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

295
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,448
And l heard the most awful rumour
about a certain lord

296
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,575
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

297
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:32,871
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

298
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,915
The logistics alone...

299
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,293
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

300
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:42,506
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.

301
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,008
Strictly speaking.

302
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:52,724
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

303
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,270
l've often wondered.

304
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,481
Do you know,
l have no idea where they are.

305
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:03,318
And we had been so close.

306
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,112
But enough about me.
How have you been

307
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,322
since we last saw each other?

308
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,950
Since you last saw me
or since l last saw you?

309
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,453
Now the last time l saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

310
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,331
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes l own.

311
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:17,958
Council business.

312
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,086
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

313
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,175
Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

314
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:30,721
lf the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

315
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:36,143
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

316
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:39,271
to think a simple word to the queen...

317
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,690
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

318
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,234
But you know something?
l do believe that l have seen you

319
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,278
even more recently
than you have seen me.

320
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:49,156
- Have you?
- Yes.

321
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,991
Earlier today, l distinctly recall

322
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,535
seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

323
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,787
Was that you under the bed?

324
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,831
And not long after that

325
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:00,584
when l saw you escorting a certain

326
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,754
foreign dignitary...

327
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,215
Council business?

328
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,551
Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

329
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:12,221
You're from there yourself, after all.

330
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,516
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

331
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,851
l'd like to think we are.

332
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,145
So you can imagine my burden,

333
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,941
wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.

334
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:28,028
To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

335
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,947
turning right loyalty to the realm...

336
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:32,366
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

337
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,409
where a simple word to the king...

338
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,662
What are you two conspiring about?

339
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,082
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

340
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:43,210
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

341
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,213
Disturbing news from far away.

342
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,883
Hadn't you heard?

343
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,914
Off with you. No begging.

344
00:26:20,998 --> 00:26:22,916
l'm not a beggar.
l live here.

345
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,169
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

346
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,129
l want to see my father.

347
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:29,965
l want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

348
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,800
You want your father, boy?

349
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:36,013
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

350
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,557
My father is Hand of the King!

351
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:41,226
l'm not a boy.
l'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.

352
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,730
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

353
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,816
Now are you going to let me by
or do l need to smack you

354
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,402
on the ear to help with your hearing?

355
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:55,073
You know l had half my guard
out searching for you?

356
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:01,788
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

357
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,541
- Who did?
- l didn't see them,

358
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,460
- but l think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.

359
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:09,213
l'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

360
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,216
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

361
00:27:12,341 --> 00:27:14,051
Something about the savage.

362
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:16,470
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

363
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:19,806
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

364
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:23,018
Chasing a cat.

365
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:26,855
Pardon, my lord.

366
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:30,234
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

367
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:40,160
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

368
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:44,331
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- l'm a girl!

369
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,041
Did Benjen send you?

370
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:50,170
No one sent me, my lord.
l'm here to find men for the Wall

371
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:53,841
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

372
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,552
- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

373
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,012
But that's not why l disturb you now.

374
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:03,141
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black

375
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:05,310
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

376
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,816
lt's for his sake l rode here so hard
l damn near killed my horse.

377
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:12,609
There are others riding too.

378
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,237
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

379
00:28:15,362 --> 00:28:17,698
Know what?

380
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,367
Best said in private, my lord.

381
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,042
Go on. We'll talk more later.

382
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:32,129
Jory, take her safely to her room.

383
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,673
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

384
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:45,475
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? 50.

385
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:48,187
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

386
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,023
No fear on that count, little lady.

387
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:59,114
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

388
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,243
She's taken the Imp.

389
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,303
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

390
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:25,933
- To whom do l speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

391
00:29:26,058 --> 00:29:30,229
- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

392
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,523
May l ask, my lady,

393
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,441
why he is with you?

394
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,194
That's why there was no time.

395
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:39,947
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

396
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:43,283
My sister will decide what he looks like.

397
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,037
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

398
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:56,505
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

399
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,259
Give me 10 good men
and some climbing spikes,

400
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,594
l'll impregnate the bitch.

401
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,430
l like you.

402
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,276
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

403
00:30:17,401 --> 00:30:19,695
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

404
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,905
l need to see the king first alone.

405
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,283
The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

406
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,368
He has summoned you.

407
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:29,371
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

408
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,124
l believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

409
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,545
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

410
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,047
l warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

411
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:41,800
l warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

412
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,136
Well, hear it now.

413
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,723
l want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

414
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,892
And that fool Viserys as well.

415
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:53,395
ls that plain enough for you?
l want them both dead.

416
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:56,023
You will dishonour yourself
forever if you do this.

417
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:59,735
Honour?!
l've got 7 kingdoms to rule!

418
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,946
1 king, 7 kingdoms.

419
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,282
Do you think honour keeps them in line?

420
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,534
Do you think it's honour
that's keeping the peace?

421
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:12,039
- It's fear, fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

422
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:16,418
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

423
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,086
because the spider heard a rumour?

424
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,006
No rumour, my lord.
The princess is with child.

425
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:24,426
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

426
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,762
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

427
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:29,264
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

428
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,976
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

429
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,771
Jorah Mormont's a slaver
not a traitor.

430
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,232
Small difference, l know,
to an honourable man.

431
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:42,027
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

432
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,154
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

433
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:47,908
And if he's right?
If she has a son?

434
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:51,286
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army

435
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,249
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

436
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:59,503
l'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

437
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:01,547
Do nothing?

438
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,966
That's your wise advice?

439
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:07,636
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

440
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,847
You're my council.
Counsel!

441
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:13,642
Speak sense to this honourable fool.

442
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:17,646
l understand your misgivings, my lord.

443
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,315
Truly, l do.
It is a terrible thing

444
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,442
we must consider, a vile thing.

445
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,820
Yet we who presume to rule

446
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,989
must sometimes do vile things

447
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:29,324
for the good of the realm.

448
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,786
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

449
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:36,748
- the realm will bleed.
- l bear this girl no ill will,

450
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:40,669
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

451
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:43,130
How many towns will burn?

452
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:46,466
ls it not wiser, kinder even,

453
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:51,805
that she should die now
so that 10's of thousands might live?

454
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,474
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

455
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,852
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

456
00:32:56,977 --> 00:33:00,230
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

457
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:03,442
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

458
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,492
l followed you into war

459
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:14,620
twice,

460
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:16,538
without doubts,

461
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:18,707
without second thoughts.

462
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,585
But l will not follow you now.

463
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:24,588
The Robert l grew up with

464
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:28,175
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

465
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,054
She dies.

466
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:35,390
l will have no part in it.

467
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:37,684
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

468
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,313
You'll do as l command
or l'll find me a Hand who will.

469
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:52,491
And good luck to him.

470
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:56,370
- l thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

471
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,163
l'm done with you.

472
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:02,334
Go, run back to Winterfell!

473
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:04,753
l'll have your head on a spike!

474
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:09,091
l'll put it there myself, you fool!

475
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:11,093
You think you're too good for this?

476
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:14,137
Too proud and honourable?
This is a war!

477
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:20,102
l'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

478
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:23,021
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

479
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,649
Lord Baelish is here for you.

480
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,361
His Grace went on about you
at some length

481
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:33,323
after you took your leave.
The word ''treason'' was mentioned.

482
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:38,203
- What can l do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

483
00:34:38,328 --> 00:34:41,206
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

484
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,002
l'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

485
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,588
lf that sort of thing still interests you.

486
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:50,299
l don't have the time.

487
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:53,468
lt won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

488
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,102
Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

489
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,689
- Who are your best 2 swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

490
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:08,901
Find them and meet me at the stables.

491
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,366
You bring him here without permission?

492
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,286
You pollute my home with his presence?

493
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:26,752
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

494
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:28,378
You remember her, don't you?

495
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,757
lsn't he beautiful?

496
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,885
And strong too. Jon knew it.

497
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,846
His last words were
''The seed is strong.''

498
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,432
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

499
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:43,060
his son would grow up to be.

500
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:46,313
Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

501
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,649
Lysa,

502
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,193
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

503
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:54,321
- warning me...
- To stay away from them!

504
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:56,990
Not to bring one here!

505
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:59,409
Mommy...

506
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:04,581
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

507
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,917
He's little.

508
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,253
He's Tyrion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

509
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:13,298
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

510
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,884
Oh, did l kill him too?

511
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:20,097
- l've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

512
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:23,016
These men are knights of the Vale.

513
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:25,811
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

514
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,813
Every one of them would die for me.

515
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,400
lf any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

516
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:34,403
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mommy!

517
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:38,323
- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

518
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,870
He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

519
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:45,706
No one will hurt my baby.

520
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:47,499
Mommy...

521
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,044
l want to see the bad man fly.

522
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,425
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

523
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,012
l will not have him harmed.

524
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,140
Ser Vardis,

525
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,018
my sister's guest is weary.

526
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:08,729
Take him down below
so he can rest.

527
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,732
lntroduce him to Mord.

528
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,653
You go sleep, dwarf man.

529
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:18,822
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

530
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,944
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

531
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,738
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

532
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:02,950
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

533
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:06,662
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if l slip.

534
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:14,086
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

535
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:16,672
lf you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

536
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,799
l want you.

537
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,970
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

538
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,514
He treats me as if l'm a spoilt child.

539
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,767
Oh, and you're not?

540
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,020
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

541
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,314
How many wars have you fought in?

542
00:38:34,356 --> 00:38:37,693
Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armour of yours?

543
00:38:37,818 --> 00:38:39,653
Hold still.

544
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,699
All l ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how l'm not tough enough,

545
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,576
how l squirm at the sight of blood.

546
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,328
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

547
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,372
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

548
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:53,083
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

549
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,336
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

550
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,922
It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

551
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,883
l'm good because l work at it

552
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,760
every day of my life
since l could hold a stick.

553
00:39:04,178 --> 00:39:07,931
l could work at fighting all day, every day,
l'd still never be as good as you.

554
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:10,434
Yes, well, l guess we'll never know.

555
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:22,946
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

556
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:25,365
So how did it end up?

557
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:30,537
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

558
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,664
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

559
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:36,293
Every time he talks about killing her,
l swear the table rises 6 inches.

560
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,254
lt's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

561
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,715
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

562
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,259
You have to give it
to the Lannisters they may be

563
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,638
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

564
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:50,390
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

565
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:55,646
- l have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

566
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:59,191
But a lot more than you.

567
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,569
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

568
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:04,696
Last time we were out there
for 2 weeks.

569
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,241
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

570
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,410
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

571
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:13,914
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

572
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,958
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

573
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,586
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

574
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,713
And he used to be good at it.

575
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:25,092
Do you know who should be king?

576
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,469
- Be serious.
- l am.

577
00:40:27,553 --> 00:40:29,721
My father could be your bank.

578
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,765
l've never fought in a war before,

579
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,643
- but l'd fight for you.
- l'm fourth in line.

580
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:37,771
And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?

581
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,107
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is 8.

582
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:42,734
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

583
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,028
He's still my older brother.

584
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:47,573
- What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

585
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,825
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

586
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:52,244
Sometimes a little spills.

587
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,539
lf you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

588
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:57,833
You need to get used to it.

589
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,918
Go on. Look.

590
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,089
People love you.

591
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,593
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

592
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:10,179
They want to be near you.

593
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,225
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

594
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,520
but you don't gloat over it.

595
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,397
You don't love killing.

596
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:28,113
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

597
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:33,035
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

598
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,540
You would be a wonderful king.

599
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:59,728
l'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

600
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,438
You seemed so good together.

601
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:04,858
l'm glad l could do something
to make you happy.

602
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:10,822
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

603
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:15,619
l suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

604
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:17,120
No.

605
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,289
He's not serious enough.

606
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:23,377
l'll say this for Ned Stark
he's serious enough.

607
00:42:23,544 --> 00:42:24,586
Hmm.

608
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:28,298
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

609
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:30,259
l don't know.

610
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,513
But l do know this

611
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:40,769
if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

612
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:44,147
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

613
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,943
we won't be able to stop them.

614
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,404
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

615
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:53,740
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armour.

616
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:57,327
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do

617
00:42:57,452 --> 00:43:00,455
you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

618
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:03,584
Is my father wrong?

619
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,965
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

620
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,677
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

621
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,138
We hole up in our castles.

622
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,973
A wise move

623
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:21,727
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

624
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,688
They leave us in our castles.

625
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:28,275
They go from town to town,
Iooting and burning,

626
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:32,154
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall

627
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:34,740
stealing all our crops and livestock,

628
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,784
enslaving all our women and children.

629
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:40,329
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

630
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:43,665
their absentee king,
their cowardly king

631
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,210
hiding behind high walls?

632
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:49,171
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

633
00:43:49,254 --> 00:43:51,673
is the rightful monarch after all?

634
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,469
We still outnumber them.

635
00:43:56,845 --> 00:44:00,140
Which is the bigger number
5 or 1?

636
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:02,643
5.

637
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:05,521
5...

638
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,441
1.

639
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,735
One army a real army

640
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:15,697
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

641
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:21,495
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

642
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,747
Now we've got as many armies

643
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:27,751
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

644
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,837
And everybody wants
something different.

645
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,130
Your father wants to own the world.

646
00:44:32,297 --> 00:44:35,551
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

647
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,678
What do you want?

648
00:44:47,646 --> 00:44:51,316
We haven't had
a real fight in 9 years.

649
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,527
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.

650
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:55,696
And that's all the realm is now

651
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,906
backstabbing and scheming

652
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,034
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

653
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:04,830
Sometimes l don't know
what holds it together.

654
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,959
Our marriage.

655
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:19,720
Ah, so here we sit,

656
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,558
17 years later,
holding it all together.

657
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,145
Don't you get tired?

658
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,731
Every day.

659
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,943
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

660
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:39,031
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

661
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,700
Yes, it is.

662
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,036
Yes, it is.

663
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:52,002
What was she like?

664
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,215
You've never asked
about her, not once.

665
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,799
Why not?

666
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,471
At first, just saying her name
even in private

667
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:05,766
felt like l was breathing life
back into her.

668
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:10,646
l thought if l didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

669
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:13,607
When l realised
that wasn't going to happen,

670
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:15,776
l refused to ask out of spite.

671
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:21,406
l didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking l cared enough to ask.

672
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,826
And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

673
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:27,829
As far as l could tell
you actually enjoyed it.

674
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:29,873
So why now?

675
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:36,004
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

676
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:39,258
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

677
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:45,138
You want to know the horrible truth?

678
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:50,394
l can't even remember
what she looked like.

679
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:58,652
l only know she was
the one thing l ever wanted.

680
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,156
Someone took her away from me,

681
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:08,579
and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

682
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:15,002
l felt something
for you once, you know?

683
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:18,088
l know.

684
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,008
Even after we lost our first boy.

685
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,845
For quite a while, actually.

686
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:33,604
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

687
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,029
No.

688
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:49,536
Does that make you feel better or worse?

689
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,335
lt doesn't make me feel anything.

690
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:12,809
She looks like him,

691
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:14,853
don't she, my lord?

692
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,898
She has his nose,
his black hair.

693
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:20,442
Aye.

694
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,528
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

695
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:26,907
lf it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

696
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:32,204
- l will.
- And tell him l've been with no one else.

697
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,749
l swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

698
00:48:35,874 --> 00:48:37,960
l don't want no jewels or nothing,

699
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:39,795
just him.

700
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,505
The king was always good to me.

701
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,757
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

702
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,011
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

703
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:50,931
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

704
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:53,058
healthy.

705
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:57,896
Looks healthy enough to me.

706
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:01,942
The girl shall want for nothing.

707
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:10,450
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

708
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:12,202
l've found.

709
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,621
Whores rarely sink.

710
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:21,753
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

711
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:25,340
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

712
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,010
- How many?
- Does it matter?

713
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,971
lf you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

714
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,015
And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

715
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,018
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

716
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,313
He was overcome with fatherly love.

717
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:43,817
Come.

718
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,201
- Jory!
- My lord.

719
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,263
Such a small pack of wolves.

720
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:17,184
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

721
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:19,228
Was the Hand of the King.

722
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:23,273
Now l'm not sure what he is
Lord of somewhere very far away.

723
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,567
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

724
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:29,905
Get back inside where it's safe.
l'm looking for my brother.

725
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,740
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

726
00:50:31,823 --> 00:50:35,953
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

727
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:40,249
- l remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

728
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:43,168
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

729
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:47,631
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

730
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:50,259
My lords!

731
00:50:50,384 --> 00:50:52,886
l'll bring the City Watch.

732
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,308
Come, Stark.
l'd rather you die sword in hand.

733
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,394
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

734
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:03,438
As in, ''l'm going to open your lord

735
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:07,150
''from balls to brains
and see what Starks are made of'?

736
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:10,112
You kill me,

737
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,698
your brother's a dead man.

738
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,575
You're right.

739
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,369
Take him alive. Kill his men.

740
00:52:25,854 --> 00:52:27,648
Yah!

741
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:56,134
My brother, Lord Stark
we want him back.

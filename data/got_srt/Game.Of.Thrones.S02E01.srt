1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,990
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:06,460
<i>I have a son, you have a daughter,</i>
<i>we'll join our houses.</i>

3
00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:10,365
May I present Viserys
of House Targaryen

4
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:12,600
<i>and his sister</i>
<i>Daenerys?</i>

5
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,637
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

6
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:20,108
Maester says the boy may live.

7
00:00:20,142 --> 00:00:23,079
My dear brother, there are times you
make me wonder whose side you're on.

8
00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:24,846
You know how much
I love my family.

9
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:26,882
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

10
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,284
<i>The Starks have</i>
<i>manned the wall</i>

11
00:00:28,318 --> 00:00:30,653
<i>for thousands of years.</i>
<i>And you are a Stark.</i>

12
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:34,290
<i>King Robert's bastards--</i>
<i>Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?</i>

13
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:36,626
<i>The King has</i>
<i>no trueborn sons.</i>

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,428
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

15
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:40,730
- No more than I love mine.
- <i>And they're all Jaime's.</i>

16
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:43,667
<i>When the King returns from</i>
<i>his hunt, I'll tell him the truth.</i>

17
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,803
I want what I came for. I want
the crown he promised me.

18
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:49,139
- No! No!
- A crown for a king.

19
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,408
<i>He was no dragon.</i>

20
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:54,245
Fire cannot kill the dragon.

21
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,380
<i>Jon Snow,</i>
<i>Lord Commander Mormont</i>

22
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:59,015
<i>has requested you</i>
<i>for his personal steward.</i>

23
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,284
He wants to groom you
for command.

24
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:02,885
Ned! We were hunting.

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,055
By the time Robert dies, it will be
too late for the both of us.

26
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,990
What about Stannis?
He's your older brother.

27
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:09,991
<i>This isn't about the bloody</i>
<i>line of succession.</i>

28
00:01:10,026 --> 00:01:11,893
He's not a king.
I am.

29
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:14,896
- We have a new king now.
- Your son has no claim to the throne.

30
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,331
Kill him! Kill all of them!
I command it!

31
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,834
You're summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new king.

32
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:23,636
Joffrey puts my father in chains;
Now he wants his ass kissed?

33
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,972
I'll go to King's Landing,
but not alone.

34
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,441
<i>Call the Banners.</i>

35
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:31,345
- <i>Kill him, Robb.</i>
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

36
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,814
So long as I am your king,

37
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:36,384
<i>treason shall never</i>
<i>go unpunished.</i>

38
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:38,519
- No! No!
- Stop, my son.

39
00:01:38,554 --> 00:01:39,987
You will go
to King's Landing

40
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:42,156
and serve as Hand
of the King in my stead.

41
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,793
<i>You'll bring that boy king to heel,</i>
<i>and his mother, too, if needs be.</i>

42
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:47,628
Please let me go home.

43
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:49,529
Mother says I'm still
to marry you,

44
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,832
so you'll stay here
and obey.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,134
My sword is yours
in victory and defeat.

46
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:58,904
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

47
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,039
What's your name?

48
00:02:00,073 --> 00:02:01,540
- Arry.
- Arry the orphan boy.

49
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:04,611
It's 1,000 leagues
from here to the Wall.

50
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:06,679
We ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

51
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:08,648
<i>The Night's Watch</i>
<i>will ride in force</i>

52
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:10,883
<i>against the wildlings,</i>
<i>the White Walkers,</i>

53
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,484
<i>and whatever else</i>
<i>is out there.</i>

54
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:15,287
He will die tonight, Khaleesi.

55
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:18,624
Drogo will have no use for
dragon eggs in the Night Lands.

56
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,860
You don't understand.

57
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:24,464
Blood of my blood.

58
00:04:41,903 --> 00:04:44,338
Well struck.

59
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,140
Well struck, Dog.

60
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:51,879
Did you like that?

61
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:53,780
It was well struck,
Your Grace.

62
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:56,150
I already said
it was well struck.

63
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,520
Yes, Your Grace.

64
00:05:06,962 --> 00:05:09,097
- Who's next?
- <i>Lothor Brune,</i>

65
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:12,601
freerider in the service
of Lord Baelish.

66
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:16,071
Ser Dontos the Red
of House Hollard.

67
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:21,577
Ser Dontos the Red
of House Hollard!

68
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,146
<i>Here I am.</i>

69
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,949
Here I am.

70
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:33,889
Sorry, Your Grace.

71
00:05:33,923 --> 00:05:35,724
My deepest apologies.

72
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,525
- <i>Are you drunk?</i>
- No.

73
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,262
Uh, no.
No, Your Grace.

74
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,064
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

75
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:45,267
That's not much at all.

76
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:47,769
Please,
have another cup.

77
00:05:47,804 --> 00:05:49,171
Are you sure, Your Grace?

78
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:51,507
<i>Yes. To celebrate</i>
<i>my name day.</i>

79
00:05:51,542 --> 00:05:54,244
Have two.
Have as much as you like.

80
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:57,215
I would be honored,
Your Grace.

81
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:01,686
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

82
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,021
See that he drinks
his fill.

83
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:24,609
You can't.

84
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,410
What did you say?

85
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:29,446
Did you say I can't?

86
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:32,149
I only meant
it would be bad luck

87
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,917
to kill a man
on your name day.

88
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,218
What kind of stupid
peasant's superstition...

89
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,087
<i>The girl is right.</i>

90
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:39,888
<i>What a man sows</i>
<i>on his name day</i>

91
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:41,457
he reaps all year.

92
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:46,629
Take him away.

93
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:48,898
I'll have him killed
tomorrow, the fool.

94
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,436
He is.

95
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,138
A fool--
you're so clever to see it.

96
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:58,575
He'll make a much better fool
than a knight.

97
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:01,912
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

98
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:06,149
Did you hear My Lady,
Ser Dontos?

99
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:09,320
From this day,
you'll be my new fool.

100
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:11,522
Thank you, Your Grace.

101
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,792
And you, My Lady,
thank you.

102
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:17,796
<i>Beloved nephew.</i>

103
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:26,704
We looked for you
on the battlefield.

104
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,042
You were nowhere
to be found.

105
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,778
I've been here,
ruling the kingdoms.

106
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:38,214
What a fine job
you've done.

107
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:39,882
Look at you.

108
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,319
More beautiful
than ever.

109
00:07:43,353 --> 00:07:47,523
And you! You-- you're going to be
bigger than the hound,

110
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:50,025
but much better looking.

111
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,961
This one doesn't like me.

112
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,830
Can't imagine why.

113
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:56,499
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

114
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:58,435
Me, too, dear.

115
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:00,737
Death is so boring,
especially now

116
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,774
with so much excitement
in the world.

117
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:06,044
My Lady, I'm sorry
for your loss.

118
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,114
Her loss?

119
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:11,049
Her father was
a confessed traitor.

120
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,684
But still her father.

121
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,720
Surely having so recently
lost your own beloved father

122
00:08:14,754 --> 00:08:16,655
you can sympathize.

123
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,594
My father was a traitor.

124
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,495
My mother and brother
are traitors, too.

125
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,732
I am loyal
to my beloved Joffrey.

126
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:31,335
Of course you are.

127
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:36,840
Well, enjoy your name day,
Your Grace.

128
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,775
Wish I could stay
and celebrate,

129
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,578
but there is work
to be done.

130
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:43,613
What work?

131
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,782
Why are you here?

132
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:51,887
The raven arrived
from the Citadel

133
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:55,057
this morning, Your Grace.

134
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:57,960
The conclave has met,
considered reports

135
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:00,129
from Maesters all over
the Seven Kingdoms,

136
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,599
<i>and declared</i>
<i>this great summer</i>

137
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:06,435
done at last.

138
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,272
The longest summer
in living memory.

139
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,274
The peasants say,
a long summer means

140
00:09:11,308 --> 00:09:14,211
- <i>an even longer winter.</i>
- <i>A common superstition.</i>

141
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:17,281
<i>We have enough wheat</i>
<i>for a 5-year winter.</i>

142
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,583
If it lasts any longer,

143
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,251
we'll have
fewer peasants.

144
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:25,254
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

145
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,755
We have nowhere
to house them.

146
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,924
And with winter coming,
it'll only get worse.

147
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,893
You command the City Watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

148
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,263
<i>I do, Your Grace.</i>

149
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:37,299
And are you not
a Lord at my command?

150
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,836
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

151
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,506
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

152
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,475
They belong in the field,
not our capital.

153
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,912
Yes, Your Grace.

154
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,251
Don't get up.

155
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,189
More ravishing than ever,
big sister.

156
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:04,993
War agrees with you.

157
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:07,929
Forgive the interruption.
Carry on.

158
00:10:09,164 --> 00:10:10,565
What are you doing here?

159
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:14,301
Ah, it's been
a remarkable journey.

160
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:18,005
I pissed off the edge
of the Wall,

161
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,941
<i>I slept in a sky cell,</i>

162
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:23,210
I fought with
the hill tribes--

163
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:25,980
so many adventures,

164
00:10:26,014 --> 00:10:28,717
so much to be
thankful for.

165
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:32,021
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

166
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:35,383
Yes. well I, do believe,
the Hand of the King,

167
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,327
is welcome at all
small council meetings.

168
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,363
Our father
is Hand of the King.

169
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:42,433
Yes, but in his absence...

170
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,842
<i>Your father has named</i>
<i>Lord Tyrion</i>

171
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:54,612
to serve as Hand
in his stead while he fights.

172
00:10:54,646 --> 00:10:57,314
Out! All of you out!

173
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:04,689
I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

174
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:06,691
If I were capable
of tricking father,

175
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,326
I'd be emperor
of the world by now.

176
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,962
You brought this
on yourself.

177
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:12,463
I've done nothing.

178
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,365
Quite right--
you did nothing

179
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,767
when your son called
for Ned Stark's head.

180
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,769
Now the entire North
has risen up against us.

181
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,272
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

182
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,442
That bit of theater will haunt
our family for a generation.

183
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:28,479
- Robb Stark is a child.
- Who's won every battle he's fought.

184
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,715
Do you understand
we're losing the war?

185
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,985
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

186
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,787
But I know people.

187
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,889
And I know that our enemies hate
each other

188
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,825
almost as much
as they hate us.

189
00:11:45,131 --> 00:11:47,766
- Joffrey is King.
- Joffrey is King.

190
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,335
You are here
to advise him.

191
00:11:50,369 --> 00:11:52,037
I'm only here
to advise him.

192
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:54,606
And if the King listens
to what I say,

193
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:58,276
the King might just get
his Uncle Jaime back.

194
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:01,479
How?

195
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,081
You love your children.

196
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:04,615
It's your one
redeeming quality.

197
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,584
That and your cheekbones.

198
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:10,453
The Starks love
their children as well.

199
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:13,089
- And we have two of them.
- One.

200
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,660
- One?
- Arya, little animal-- she disappeared.

201
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,730
Disappeared?
What, in a puff of smoke?

202
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:25,802
We had three Starks
to trade.

203
00:12:25,836 --> 00:12:28,572
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

204
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,574
Father will be furious.

205
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,244
It must be odd for you...

206
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:39,049
to be the disappointing child.

207
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,395
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>
<i>watch over your brother</i>

208
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,098
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

209
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:57,102
<i>The walls of my Holdfast</i>
<i>will not stand the winter.</i>

210
00:12:57,137 --> 00:13:01,006
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

211
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,408
and I'm afraid
the masons today

212
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:07,178
are not fit to carry
their fathers' hammers.

213
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:09,613
When I was a boy,
I remember seeing them

214
00:13:09,648 --> 00:13:14,217
<i>put up a new tower</i>
<i>at Torrhen's Square in a summer.</i>

215
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:16,353
<i>Men worked back then.</i>

216
00:13:16,387 --> 00:13:19,289
Today, my Holdfast
looks like it was built

217
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:21,558
by drunk children.

218
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,730
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

219
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,732
<i>And the Gods</i>
<i>forbid it rains.</i>

220
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,002
Why, I might as well sleep
beneath a waterfall.

221
00:13:31,036 --> 00:13:32,671
<i>Maintenance of a Holdfast</i>

222
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:36,108
generally falls
to the lord of that Holdfast.

223
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:37,610
Generally, yes,

224
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,311
but I've sent
all the young men off

225
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:41,247
to fight
Robb Stark's war.

226
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:44,383
King Robb.
And it's not his war.

227
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:46,318
He didn't choose it.

228
00:13:46,352 --> 00:13:47,786
Maybe not, My Lord,

229
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,921
but he called in his Banners
and took the men.

230
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,689
<i>Joffrey killed my father,</i>

231
00:13:51,723 --> 00:13:54,158
your liege lord.

232
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,660
Do you remember
your vows, Ser?

233
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:58,562
Of course I remember!

234
00:13:58,596 --> 00:14:01,665
We can spare 4 masons
for a week, My Lord.

235
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,735
Will that be sufficient
to repair your walls?

236
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,071
I-- I believe it will.

237
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:15,381
We didn't want him here
all day, did we?

238
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,685
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

239
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,520
Nor did I.

240
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,658
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

241
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:30,763
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

242
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,934
<i>Lord Portan.</i>

243
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:39,003
<i>My Lord, may the Old Gods</i>
<i>watch over your brother</i>

244
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:40,771
<i>and all our northern sons.</i>

245
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:34,161
Boil this for an hour
and drink the tea.

246
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:36,698
Makes all your pain
go away.

247
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:39,367
Don't have any pain.

248
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:41,001
Lucky for you.

249
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,904
That way.

250
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:48,876
You've been having
those dreams again.

251
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,744
<i>I don't dream.</i>

252
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:52,312
Everyone dreams.

253
00:15:52,346 --> 00:15:55,281
I don't.

254
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:57,383
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

255
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,552
<i>They say it's an omen.</i>

256
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:03,256
They say it means Robb will win
a great victory in the South.

257
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,891
Did they?

258
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,230
I heard some other fools
say it's Lannister Red.

259
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:13,634
Means the Lannisters will rule
all Seven Kingdoms before long.

260
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:17,071
Heard a stableboy say
it's the color of blood

261
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:19,474
to mark the death
of your father.

262
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:26,547
The stars
don't fall for men.

263
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:29,149
The red comet means
one thing, boy--

264
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,885
dragons.

265
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:36,455
The dragons are all dead.

266
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,958
They've been dead
for centuries.

267
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:17,264
Mmm.

268
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:20,233
Mmm. Mmm.

269
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,971
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

270
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:26,673
He said they ate meat.

271
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:30,410
He didn't tell you
what kind of meat?

272
00:17:30,444 --> 00:17:33,346
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

273
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,515
He didn't know anything
about anything.

274
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:43,990
Eh.

275
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,387
She was Drogo's
first gift to me.

276
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:15,423
I remember.

277
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:19,928
I promised
to protect them.

278
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:22,296
Promised them their enemies
would die screaming.

279
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:24,832
How do I make
starvation scream?

280
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,869
A trick I never learned,
I'm afraid.

281
00:18:29,705 --> 00:18:31,772
Does it ever end?

282
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,774
This is farther east
than I've ever been.

283
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,342
But, yes, Khaleesi,

284
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,844
everything ends,
even the red waste.

285
00:18:36,878 --> 00:18:39,446
And you're sure
there's no other way?

286
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:42,216
If we go south to the land
of the Lazarheen,

287
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,718
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

288
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,653
If we go west
to the Dothraki Sea,

289
00:18:46,688 --> 00:18:48,722
the first
Khalasar we meet

290
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,290
will kill us
and take your dragons.

291
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:52,993
No one will take
my dragons.

292
00:18:54,162 --> 00:18:56,864
They are too weak to fight,

293
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:58,899
as are your people.

294
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,269
You must be
their strength.

295
00:19:02,204 --> 00:19:04,339
As you are mine.

296
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:54,255
Rakharo...

297
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:03,532
You never have.

298
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,206
This is bad time to start.

299
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:10,266
Having a rough time of it?

300
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,867
Nothing's killed me yet.

301
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:14,470
- Your ass killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

302
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:17,740
I just wanted you to shut up about
your damn blisters.

303
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:34,556
I was born in a place
like this.

304
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:37,726
Later, I fell
on hard times.

305
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:41,129
<i>Are those girls?</i>

306
00:21:41,163 --> 00:21:42,964
<i>Craster's daughters.</i>

307
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:46,735
I haven't seen a girl
in 6 months.

308
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:48,704
I'd keep on not seeing them
if I were you.

309
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:52,140
What, he don't like people messing
with his daughters?

310
00:21:52,175 --> 00:21:54,977
He don't like people
messing with his wives.

311
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:58,580
He marries
his daughters,

312
00:21:58,615 --> 00:22:00,950
<i>and they give him</i>
<i>more daughters.</i>

313
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:03,185
And on and on it goes.

314
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,654
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

315
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:09,592
All the other wildlings for a
hundred leagues have disappeared.

316
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,593
Craster's still here.

317
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:14,263
He must be doing
something right.

318
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,600
What happens
to the boys?

319
00:22:17,634 --> 00:22:20,669
- Hmm?
- <i>He marries his daughters.</i>

320
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:23,606
What does he do
with his sons?

321
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:28,644
He said he planned
to stop here

322
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,246
on his way
to the Frostfangs.

323
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,881
People make
all sorts of plans.

324
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:35,351
I haven't seen Benjen Stark
in 3 years.

325
00:22:35,385 --> 00:22:36,852
Haven't missed him.

326
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:39,622
Always treated me
like scum.

327
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:43,526
Haven't had any good wine
for a long time.

328
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,562
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

329
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:48,631
We're not Southerners.

330
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,400
Who's this little girl?

331
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:54,671
You're prettier
than half my daughters.

332
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,041
You got a nice wet twat
between your legs?

333
00:22:58,075 --> 00:22:59,809
What's your name?

334
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:01,844
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

335
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:04,713
Listen to me, bastard.

336
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:08,717
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

337
00:23:08,751 --> 00:23:12,621
But now you're in the North,
the real North.

338
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,255
The lad meant no harm.

339
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:18,993
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters--

340
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:23,165
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

341
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:26,536
Now, sit down
and shut your mouth.

342
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,542
You bring any of that
good wine with you?

343
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,411
We did.

344
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,947
We passed through
6 villages on the way here.

345
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,815
All 6 were abandoned.

346
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,918
Where have all
the wildlings gone?

347
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,488
I could tell you,
but I'm thirsty.

348
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:46,624
<i>There's a barrel of</i>
<i>Dornish wine on the sledge.</i>

349
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:49,393
- <i>Bring it in here.</i>
- <i>Yes, commander.</i>

350
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,596
<i>You want to know</i>
<i>where they've all gone?</i>

351
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,933
<i>North... to join up</i>
<i>with Mance Rayder...</i>

352
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,835
Your old friend.

353
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,505
He's no friend of mine.

354
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,672
He broke his vows,
betrayed his brothers.

355
00:24:05,697 --> 00:24:06,897
Oh, aye.

356
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:10,081
But once he was
just a poor black crow.

357
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,051
And now he's
King-Beyond-the-Wall.

358
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:15,554
He's been calling
himself that for years.

359
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:19,325
What's he king of?
A frozen lake somewhere?

360
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:22,762
That's a good-looking axe.

361
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:24,931
<i>Fresh forged?</i>

362
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,469
Give it here.

363
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:31,671
You'll have another one
made at Castle Black.

364
00:24:31,706 --> 00:24:33,607
Here.

365
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:37,444
Oh, that's some
lovely steel.

366
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:44,284
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

367
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,119
Gathering an army.

368
00:24:46,187 --> 00:24:48,388
<i>What I hear,</i>
<i>he's already got more men</i>

369
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:50,724
<i>than any of your</i>
<i>southern kings.</i>

370
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:53,260
And where does he plan
marching this army?

371
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:54,761
When you're
all the way north,

372
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,530
there's only
one direction to go.

373
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:03,370
These are bad times to be
living alone in the wild.

374
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:06,707
The cold winds
are rising.

375
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:10,244
Let them come.
My roots are sunk deep.

376
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:13,747
Wife...

377
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:17,818
tell the Lord Crow
how content we are.

378
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,220
This is our place.

379
00:25:20,254 --> 00:25:22,155
Our husband keeps us safe.

380
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,359
Better to live free
than die a slave.

381
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:30,631
<i>Don't it make you</i>
<i>jealous, old man,</i>

382
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:32,733
to see me with
all these young wives

383
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:36,036
and you with no one
to warm your bed?

384
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,005
We chose different paths.

385
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:42,476
Oh, aye, and you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

386
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:47,480
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

387
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:49,582
and eat me out of pigs.

388
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:51,518
A roof would be welcome.

389
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,086
It's been hard riding.

390
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,322
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

391
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:01,661
Any man lays a hand
on one of my wives,

392
00:26:01,695 --> 00:26:04,664
he loses the hand.

393
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,302
And I see this one
staring too long,

394
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:13,572
I might just gouge
his eyes out.

395
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:16,876
Your roof, your rules.

396
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:32,159
Who am I?!

397
00:26:32,194 --> 00:26:35,630
- Who am I?!
- Lord commander.

398
00:26:35,664 --> 00:26:38,833
- And who are you?
- Jon Snow.

399
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:41,469
Who <i>are</i> you?

400
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:43,771
Your steward.

401
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:45,906
You want to lead
one day?

402
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:51,411
Then learn
how to follow.

403
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,667
<i>Lord of Light, come to us</i>
<i>in our darkness.</i>

404
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:17,405
We offer you
these false Gods.

405
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:20,374
Take them and cast
your light upon us...

406
00:27:22,077 --> 00:27:26,113
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

407
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:29,649
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

408
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,552
<i>After the long summer,</i>

409
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:36,622
<i>darkness will fall heavy</i>
<i>on the world.</i>

410
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,358
The stars will bleed.

411
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,761
We need to stop her.

412
00:27:41,795 --> 00:27:45,598
<i>The cold breath of winter</i>
<i>will freeze the seas...</i>

413
00:27:45,632 --> 00:27:47,030
Not now.

414
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:49,255
<i>...And the dead shall rise</i>
<i>in the North.</i>

415
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:55,375
All you men were named
in the Light of the Seven!

416
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:58,545
<i>Is this how you treat</i>
<i>the Gods of your fathers?</i>

417
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,283
Are you so eager to spit
on your ancestors?

418
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:14,292
You smell of fear--

419
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,596
fear and piss
and old bones.

420
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,532
Do you want to stop me?

421
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,838
Stop me.

422
00:28:40,653 --> 00:28:42,387
In the ancient books,
it's written

423
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:46,458
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

424
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:50,662
And that sword shall be
Lightbringer.

425
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:58,971
Stannis Baratheon,

426
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:01,573
warrior of light,

427
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:03,509
your sword awaits you.

428
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:37,244
Lord, cast your
light upon us!

429
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,115
<i>For the night is dark</i>
<i>and full of terrors.</i>

430
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:48,421
For the night is dark
and full of terror.

431
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:19,118
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

432
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:20,786
Stannis is our king.

433
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,154
We follow
where he leads,

434
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:24,890
- even if we don't like the path.
- King.

435
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:27,025
Since that boar
killed his brother,

436
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,094
every lord wants
a coronation.

437
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,229
I don't serve the others.
I serve Stannis.

438
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:34,966
As do I,
but loyal service

439
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,936
means telling
hard truths.

440
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,039
He's surrounded
by fools and fanatics,

441
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,842
but he trusts you, Davos.

442
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,979
If you tell him
the truth...

443
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:51,317
What's the truth?

444
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,765
<i>"And I declare upon</i>
<i>the honor of my house</i>

445
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,233
<i>that my beloved</i>
<i>brother Robert--"</i>

446
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,869
he wasn't
my beloved brother.

447
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:12,104
I didn't love him.
He didn't love me.

448
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,973
A harmless courtesy,
Your Grace.

449
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,374
A lie.
Take it out.

450
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,212
"...that my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

451
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,648
the boy Joffrey,
the boy Tommen,

452
00:31:22,682 --> 00:31:24,850
and the girl Myrcella
being born of incest

453
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,888
<i>between Cersei Lannister and</i>
<i>her brother Jaime Lannister.</i>

454
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:30,824
- <i>By right of birth--"</i>
- Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

455
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:33,660
Call him what he is.

456
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:35,195
<i>"...And her brother</i>
<i>Jaime Lannister,</i>

457
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,597
<i>the Kingslayer.</i>

458
00:31:36,632 --> 00:31:39,868
<i>By right of birth and blood,</i>
<i>I do this day lay claim--"</i>

459
00:31:39,902 --> 00:31:43,037
<i>Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the Kingslayer.</i>

460
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,273
Whatever else he is,
the man's still a knight.

461
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:47,342
"Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

462
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:49,711
By right of birth
and blood,

463
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:53,182
<i>I do this day lay claim</i>
<i>to the Iron Throne of Westeros.</i>

464
00:31:53,216 --> 00:31:55,717
Let all true men
declare their loyalty."

465
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:58,086
When Eddard Stark learned
the truth, he told only me.

466
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:00,522
I'll not make
the same mistake.

467
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:02,591
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the Realm,

468
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,492
from the Arbor
to the Wall.

469
00:32:04,527 --> 00:32:07,429
The time has come
to choose.

470
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:09,931
Let no man claim ignorance
as an excuse.

471
00:32:09,966 --> 00:32:12,567
Your Grace,the Lannisters
are the true enemy.

472
00:32:12,602 --> 00:32:14,636
If, for the time being, you could
make peace with your brother--

473
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,938
I'll not make peace with Renly
while he calls himself King.

474
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,807
Well, many have already
declared for him--

475
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:20,976
Mace Tyrell,
Randyll Tarly.

476
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,246
Stannis does not need to beg
this lord or that lord for support.

477
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,848
<i>The Lord of Light</i>
<i>stands behind him.</i>

478
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:29,351
And how many ships has
the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

479
00:32:29,386 --> 00:32:31,954
- He has no need for ships.
- I'm sure he doesn't,

480
00:32:31,988 --> 00:32:33,389
but we do if we're
going to war.

481
00:32:33,423 --> 00:32:36,492
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

482
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,828
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

483
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:40,163
I've always served thieves
according to their desserts,

484
00:32:40,197 --> 00:32:42,332
<i>as you well know,</i>
<i>Ser Davos.</i>

485
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:45,367
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark,
they're all thieves.

486
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:47,870
They'll bend the knee
or I'll destroy them.

487
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:52,474
I owe you
an apology, my King.

488
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,577
My duty is to serve.

489
00:32:54,611 --> 00:32:58,680
<i>You have chosen the new God</i>
<i>over the Old Gods.</i>

490
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:02,217
<i>May the Lord of Light</i>
<i>watch over us all.</i>

491
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:04,619
Shall we drink together?

492
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,655
Don't.

493
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:11,494
A cup of wine to honor
the one true God.

494
00:33:57,611 --> 00:34:00,813
The night is dark and full
of terrors, old man,

495
00:34:00,848 --> 00:34:04,083
but the fire
burns them all away.

496
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,640
Your Grace.

497
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,689
King in the North.

498
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,426
I keep expecting you
to leave me

499
00:34:45,461 --> 00:34:47,495
in one castle or another
for safekeeping,

500
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,566
but you drag me along
from camp to camp.

501
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,235
Have you grown
fond of me, Stark?

502
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,070
Is that it?

503
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:58,106
I've never seen you
with a girl.

504
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:01,643
If I left you with
one of my bannermen,

505
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:04,713
your father would know
within a fortnight

506
00:35:04,747 --> 00:35:08,217
and my bannerman would receive
a raven with a message:

507
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:11,820
"Release my son and you'll be rich
beyond your dreams.

508
00:35:11,855 --> 00:35:15,391
Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

509
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:17,726
You don't trust
the loyalty

510
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:20,062
of the men following
you into battle?

511
00:35:20,097 --> 00:35:23,600
Oh, I trust them
with my life,

512
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:25,635
just not with yours.

513
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:27,503
Smart boy.

514
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:29,172
What's wrong?

515
00:35:29,206 --> 00:35:31,173
<i>Don't like</i>
<i>being called "boy"?</i>

516
00:35:32,108 --> 00:35:34,143
Insulted?

517
00:35:41,117 --> 00:35:43,985
<i>You insult yourself,</i>
<i>Kingslayer.</i>

518
00:35:45,654 --> 00:35:49,056
<i>You've been defeated by a boy.</i>

519
00:35:49,091 --> 00:35:51,558
<i>You're held captive</i>
<i>by a boy.</i>

520
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:56,263
<i>Perhaps you'll be</i>
<i>killed by a boy.</i>

521
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:04,772
Stannis Baratheon
sent ravens

522
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:08,176
to all the high lords
of Westeros.

523
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:11,881
King Joffrey Baratheon
is neither a true king

524
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:14,550
<i>nor a true Baratheon.</i>

525
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:16,719
He's your bastard son.

526
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:19,323
<i>If that's true,</i>
<i>Stannis is the rightful king.</i>

527
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,391
How convenient for him.

528
00:36:21,425 --> 00:36:25,695
My father learned
the truth.

529
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,397
That's why
you had him executed.

530
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,800
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

531
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,936
Your son killed him

532
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,404
so the world wouldn't
learn who fathered him.

533
00:36:33,438 --> 00:36:37,475
And you-- you pushed
my brother from a window

534
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:39,477
because he saw you
with the queen.

535
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:47,686
You have proof?

536
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,222
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

537
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:52,425
I'm sending one of your cousins
down to King's Landing

538
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,094
with my peace terms.

539
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,164
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

540
00:36:57,198 --> 00:36:59,600
You don't know him
very well.

541
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:04,004
No, but he's starting
to know me.

542
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:07,673
<i>3 victories</i>
<i>don't make you a conqueror.</i>

543
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:11,777
It's better than
3 defeats.

544
00:37:40,209 --> 00:37:42,810
<i>This city stinks...</i>

545
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:46,781
Like dead bodies.

546
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:48,949
<i>A bit corpsey, yes.</i>

547
00:37:48,983 --> 00:37:51,451
And shit.

548
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:53,386
I thought you wanted
to come here.

549
00:37:56,723 --> 00:37:59,091
I love it.

550
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:02,795
You love the smell
of dead bodies and shit?

551
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:05,865
And cum and garlic
and rum.

552
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:09,035
You can smell cum
from the balcony?

553
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:12,406
I love the stink.
I love the noise.

554
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,542
Cities make me
want to fuck.

555
00:38:14,576 --> 00:38:17,879
And so did the country.

556
00:38:20,983 --> 00:38:22,483
This is where I belong.

557
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:25,386
Yes, well, you need
to be careful.

558
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,987
No one can know
you're here.

559
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:28,689
No one will know.

560
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,290
You can't trust anyone
in King's Landing.

561
00:38:30,325 --> 00:38:33,493
<i>They're all liars--</i>
<i>good liars, bad liars,</i>

562
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,962
one or two great liars.

563
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:37,997
What about you?

564
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:40,666
Me? I'm not from here.
I'm a slave to the truth.

565
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,502
Truth?

566
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:48,474
You are the biggest
little liar I have ever met.

567
00:38:48,508 --> 00:38:50,509
Why do you think
I am so little?

568
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:55,079
I'm being crushed beneath the
weight of all that truth.

569
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,216
Oh!

570
00:38:59,251 --> 00:39:02,053
Ned Stark actually
slept on this.

571
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:05,924
As if the poor man
didn't suffer enough.

572
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:11,197
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

573
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:25,677
- Lord Baelish.
- Your Grace.

574
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:28,280
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

575
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:29,815
Of course,
Your Grace.

576
00:39:29,849 --> 00:39:31,783
Ned Stark's youngest
daughter Arya--

577
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:34,019
we can't seem
to locate her.

578
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:36,554
If she's escaped
the capital,

579
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:38,656
Winterfell seems
the logical destination.

580
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,226
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

581
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,194
Curious.

582
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:45,363
If we choose to negotiate
with the Starks,

583
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:47,666
the girl has some value.
Whoever finds her--

584
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,235
well, you know what they say about
Lannisters and debts.

585
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,271
Well, you could ask
Varys where she is.

586
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,607
He'll have
an answer for you.

587
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,209
Whether you believe it...

588
00:39:56,243 --> 00:40:00,114
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

589
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,783
Who knows what they want?

590
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,919
A mockingbird.

591
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:07,713
You created your
own Sigil, didn't you?

592
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,938
Yes.

593
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,792
Appropriate...
for a self-made man

594
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,560
with so many
songs to sing.

595
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:15,228
I'm glad you like it.

596
00:40:15,263 --> 00:40:17,131
Some people are
fortunate enough

597
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,798
to be born into
the right family.

598
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,501
Others have to find
their own way.

599
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,904
I heard a song once

600
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:27,573
about a boy
of modest means

601
00:40:27,607 --> 00:40:31,343
who found his way into the
home of a very prominent family.

602
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:33,145
He loved
the eldest daughter.

603
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:36,582
Sadly, she had eyes
for another.

604
00:40:36,616 --> 00:40:38,984
When boys and girls
live in the same home,

605
00:40:39,018 --> 00:40:41,653
awkward situations
can arise.

606
00:40:41,687 --> 00:40:44,322
Sometimes, I've heard,
even brothers and sisters

607
00:40:44,356 --> 00:40:46,857
develop
certain affections.

608
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:49,326
And when these affections
become common knowledge,

609
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,229
well, that is an awkward
situation indeed,

610
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:55,565
especially
in a prominent family.

611
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,035
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

612
00:40:59,069 --> 00:41:01,304
I've found.

613
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:03,473
And which truth is that?

614
00:41:03,507 --> 00:41:07,144
Knowledge is power.

615
00:41:09,314 --> 00:41:11,716
Seize him.

616
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:15,554
Cut his throat.

617
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:19,158
Stop. Wait.

618
00:41:19,192 --> 00:41:21,561
I've changed my mind.
Let him go.

619
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:26,198
Step back 3 paces.

620
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:30,002
Turn around.

621
00:41:30,036 --> 00:41:31,703
Close your eyes.

622
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:38,344
Power is power.

623
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,566
Do see if you can
take some time away from

624
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:43,505
your coins and your whores

625
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,651
to locate
the Stark girl for me.

626
00:41:45,685 --> 00:41:49,221
I would very much
appreciate it.

627
00:41:59,032 --> 00:42:01,233
<i>You're Ser Alton Lannister?</i>

628
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:03,836
I am, Your Grace.

629
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,407
<i>I offer your cousins peace</i>
<i>if they meet my terms.</i>

630
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,744
First, your family
must release my sisters.

631
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:15,447
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

632
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:17,415
so he may rest beside
his brother and sister

633
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,185
in the crypts
beneath Winterfell.

634
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:22,388
And the remains of all those
who died in his service

635
00:42:22,422 --> 00:42:24,623
must also be returned.

636
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:27,160
Their families can honor
them with proper funerals.

637
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:30,263
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- <i>Third...</i>

638
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,402
Joffrey and the Queen Regent
must renounce all claim

639
00:42:34,436 --> 00:42:37,038
to dominion of the North.

640
00:42:37,073 --> 00:42:39,274
From this time
till the end of time,

641
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:41,843
we are a free
and independent kingdom.

642
00:42:41,878 --> 00:42:43,845
The King in the North.

643
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,347
King in the North.

644
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:47,949
Neither Joffrey
nor any of his men

645
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:50,218
shall set foot
in our lands again.

646
00:42:50,286 --> 00:42:52,153
If he disregards
this command,

647
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:55,724
he shall suffer
the same fate as my father,

648
00:42:55,758 --> 00:43:00,061
only I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

649
00:43:00,095 --> 00:43:03,598
These are-- Your Grace,
these are--

650
00:43:03,632 --> 00:43:06,167
these are my terms.

651
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:09,337
If the Queen Regent and her son
meet them, I'll give them peace.

652
00:43:09,371 --> 00:43:12,340
If not...

653
00:43:12,374 --> 00:43:14,809
I will litter the south
with Lannister dead.

654
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:17,746
King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
Your Grace.

655
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,581
Oh, is he?

656
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:24,119
You'll ride at daybreak,
Ser Alton.

657
00:43:24,154 --> 00:43:26,788
That will be all
for tonight.

658
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:43,672
A word, Your Grace?

659
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:48,176
You don't have to call me
"Your Grace" when no one's around.

660
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,913
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

661
00:43:50,947 --> 00:43:52,781
I'm glad someone's
gotten used to it.

662
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:56,151
The Lannisters are going to reject
your terms, you know?

663
00:43:56,185 --> 00:43:57,886
Of course they are.

664
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,255
We can fight them
in the fields as long as you like,

665
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,992
but we won't beat them until you
take King's Landing.

666
00:44:05,528 --> 00:44:08,664
And we can't take
King's Landing without ships.

667
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:11,333
My father has ships and men
who know how to sail them.

668
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:13,135
Men who fought
my father.

669
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,604
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

670
00:44:15,638 --> 00:44:19,442
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

671
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,680
I'm his only living son.

672
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:26,850
He'll listen to me.
I know he will.

673
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:32,555
I'm not a Stark.
I know that.

674
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,559
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

675
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:39,830
We can avenge him
together.

676
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:44,101
You don't want
Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

677
00:44:44,135 --> 00:44:46,403
I need his ships.
They say he has 200.

678
00:44:46,438 --> 00:44:50,007
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

679
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:51,976
Shall we rally them
to fight for us?

680
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,844
I understand you don't
trust Lord Greyjoy.

681
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:58,549
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because
he is not trustworthy.

682
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,218
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

683
00:45:01,253 --> 00:45:05,123
Yes. And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

684
00:45:05,157 --> 00:45:07,425
Before me, it was father.

685
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:09,126
You married one rebel
and mothered another.

686
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,163
I mothered more than
just rebels,

687
00:45:12,197 --> 00:45:14,531
a fact you seem
to have forgotten.

688
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:16,567
If I trade the Kingslayer
for two girls,

689
00:45:16,601 --> 00:45:18,868
my bannermen will string me up
by my feet.

690
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:22,072
You want to leave Sansa
in the Queen's hands?

691
00:45:22,106 --> 00:45:24,174
<i>And Arya--</i>

692
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:27,210
I haven't heard
a word about Arya.

693
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:28,979
What are we fighting for
if not for them?

694
00:45:29,013 --> 00:45:30,614
It's more complicated
than that!

695
00:45:30,648 --> 00:45:32,783
You know it is.

696
00:45:47,233 --> 00:45:50,836
It's time for me
to go home.

697
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,772
I haven't seen Bran
or Rickon in months.

698
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:57,443
You can't go
to Winterfell.

699
00:45:57,477 --> 00:45:59,445
I beg your pardon?

700
00:45:59,479 --> 00:46:02,614
I'll send Rodrik
to watch over the boys

701
00:46:02,649 --> 00:46:07,185
because tomorrow
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

702
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:09,220
Why in the name
of all the Gods--

703
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:13,157
because I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

704
00:46:13,192 --> 00:46:15,326
He's rallied
an army of 100,000.

705
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:17,095
You know him.
You know his family.

706
00:46:17,129 --> 00:46:19,563
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

707
00:46:19,598 --> 00:46:21,132
<i>You have a hundred</i>
<i>other lords--</i>

708
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:25,036
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

709
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,872
If Renly sides with us,

710
00:46:27,907 --> 00:46:30,341
we'll outnumber them
2 to 1.

711
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,311
When they feel the jaws beginning
to shut, they'll sue for peace.

712
00:46:33,345 --> 00:46:36,080
We'll get the girls back.

713
00:46:36,114 --> 00:46:39,617
Then we'll all
go home... for good.

714
00:46:46,725 --> 00:46:49,694
I will ride at first light.

715
00:46:58,337 --> 00:47:01,939
We will all be together
again soon, I promise.

716
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:09,546
You've done so well.

717
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:14,718
Your father
would be... proud.

718
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:25,463
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- <i>King</i> Renly.

719
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:29,568
There's a king
in every corner now.

720
00:47:42,515 --> 00:47:45,049
What is all this?

721
00:47:45,084 --> 00:47:47,352
Returning this room
to its proper appearance.

722
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:50,254
Say what you will about the Targaryens--
they were conquerors.

723
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:53,124
That is a seat
for a conqueror.

724
00:47:53,158 --> 00:47:56,827
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

725
00:47:56,861 --> 00:47:59,229
We can't find Arya Stark.

726
00:47:59,264 --> 00:48:01,398
With luck, she's dead
in a ditch somewhere.

727
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:03,400
Perhaps. But if not,
we need her.

728
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:05,769
They'll never give Jaime back
to us for Sansa alone.

729
00:48:05,804 --> 00:48:08,405
I think they might.
They're weak.

730
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,274
They put too much value
on their women.

731
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:14,144
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

732
00:48:14,179 --> 00:48:16,046
Send out as many men
as we can.

733
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:17,882
I'm sure if you asked
grandfather--

734
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:21,919
The King does not ask;
He commands.

735
00:48:21,953 --> 00:48:24,822
And my grandfather's
stupidity in the field of battle

736
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:27,758
is the reason Robb Stark has
Uncle Jaime in the first place.

737
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:30,493
His life is in danger.

738
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:32,162
We're at war.

739
00:48:32,196 --> 00:48:35,297
All our lives
are in danger.

740
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:41,804
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime.

741
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:43,472
And you.

742
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:46,142
Our enemies
will say anything

743
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:48,177
to weaken your claim
to the throne.

744
00:48:48,212 --> 00:48:50,347
It's not a claim.
The throne is mine.

745
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:53,751
Of course it is.

746
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:57,622
No one believes
this foul gossip.

747
00:48:57,656 --> 00:48:59,791
Someone believes it.

748
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:03,761
Father had
other children?

749
00:49:03,796 --> 00:49:06,331
Besides me and Tommen
and Myrcella?

750
00:49:08,134 --> 00:49:10,101
What are you asking?

751
00:49:10,135 --> 00:49:12,537
I'm asking if he fucked
other women

752
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:14,106
when he grew tired
of you.

753
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,941
How many bastards
does he have running--

754
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:35,926
What you just did
is punishable by death.

755
00:49:39,363 --> 00:49:42,065
You will never
do it again.

756
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:44,034
Never.

757
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:52,175
That will be all,
Mother.

758
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,884
No, no, no, no.

759
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:03,721
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

760
00:50:03,755 --> 00:50:05,223
Ease into it.

761
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:08,259
Slowly, with passion.

762
00:50:08,293 --> 00:50:12,030
Oh, yeah.

763
00:50:12,065 --> 00:50:15,934
Go wash yourselves.
Put some clothes on.

764
00:50:15,969 --> 00:50:18,571
Both of you
are working tonight.

765
00:50:22,341 --> 00:50:24,309
We do things
differently here, Daisy.

766
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:28,312
This isn't some 5-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

767
00:50:28,346 --> 00:50:30,847
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

768
00:50:30,882 --> 00:50:32,716
Our establishment
doesn't cater

769
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,518
to ploughmen
and goat herders.

770
00:50:35,552 --> 00:50:37,653
Lord Olsen.

771
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:39,388
Taste is
everything here.

772
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:41,290
Littlefinger's
a fancy man.

773
00:50:41,324 --> 00:50:43,092
Don't call him
Littlefinger.

774
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:44,560
He doesn't like it.

775
00:50:44,595 --> 00:50:47,063
<i>Lord Baelish.</i>

776
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,838
She pretends she doesn't
speak the common tongue

777
00:50:54,873 --> 00:50:57,441
so that people
will think she's exotic.

778
00:50:57,476 --> 00:51:00,378
She grew up just down the road
in flea bottom.

779
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:02,981
She's beautiful.

780
00:51:03,015 --> 00:51:06,251
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

781
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:13,625
Lord Commander.

782
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:16,794
Good to see you...
Again.

783
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:33,245
You do realize
this establishment

784
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,615
is owned by
Lord Petyr Baelish,

785
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:37,817
the King's
Master of Coin...

786
00:51:37,852 --> 00:51:39,786
Coin which goes
in many pockets.

787
00:51:39,821 --> 00:51:42,523
- Orders.
- Whose orders?

788
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:45,558
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

789
00:52:03,176 --> 00:52:06,712
No, you can't.
No! Please!

790
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:09,415
No! Not my Barra!

791
00:52:09,449 --> 00:52:12,852
- Please. Please.
- Enough. Get it done.

792
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:14,920
- <i>Kill the bastard.</i>
- <i>No, no!</i>

793
00:52:14,955 --> 00:52:17,456
- <i>Please.</i>
- Give it here.

794
00:52:17,491 --> 00:52:20,026
No, please.

795
00:52:29,936 --> 00:52:32,271
<i>Spread out.</i>
<i>Search every house.</i>

796
00:52:32,305 --> 00:52:34,873
<i>Every room.</i>
<i>Look in every room.</i>

797
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:01,832
Gendry!
His name is Gendry.

798
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:03,734
Where is
the bastard?

799
00:53:03,768 --> 00:53:06,370
The Night's Watch!
Please, stop!

800
00:53:06,404 --> 00:53:07,771
Where?

801
00:53:07,805 --> 00:53:10,774
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

802
00:53:10,808 --> 00:53:14,410
- How will we know him?
- <i>He's got a bull's head helmet.</i>

803
00:53:14,444 --> 00:53:17,679
- <i>He made it himself.</i>
- Find him.

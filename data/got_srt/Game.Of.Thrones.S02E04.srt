1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:02,178
Does it ever end?

2
00:00:02,198 --> 00:00:04,366
This is further east
than I've ever been.

3
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:13,089
May I present my wife
Margaery of House Tyrell?

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:15,089
You are very welcome
here, Lady Stark.

5
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:17,638
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us,
he should come himself.

6
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:20,349
My son is fighting a war,

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,351
not playing at one.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,603
I cannot defeat
my brother in the field.

9
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,119
You must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

10
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:29,733
I've said the words,
damn you.

11
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:32,650
I will give you a son.

12
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:35,711
We've come to
a dangerous place.

13
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:39,701
My sister wants to hurt me.
She can't know about you.

14
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:40,648
Who are you?

15
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,704
I'm Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.

16
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:45,033
I didn't know I needed
a new handmaiden.

17
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,023
You fought bravely today,
Lady Brienne.

18
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,921
I fought for my king. Soon I'll
fight for him on the battlefield.

19
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,621
Die for him
if I must.

20
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:01,785
You told the Queen
about my plans

21
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:03,976
- to send Myrcella to Dorne.
- Never!

22
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:05,804
Throw him in one
of the black cells.

23
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,787
Myrcella is
my only daughter.

24
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:10,406
Do you really think I'll let you
sell her like a common whore?

25
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:11,711
- It's done, Cersei.
- No.

26
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:14,171
- You cannot stop it.
- No!

27
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:15,863
Not tonight.

28
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,488
There's another Tyrell
who requires your attention.

29
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,367
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:22,307
Do you want my brother
to come in and help?

31
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:23,704
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32
00:01:23,724 --> 00:01:27,082
There's no need for us to play games.
Save your lies for court.

33
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:28,509
You're going to need
a lot of them.

34
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,961
My brother Jaime rots
in a northern stockade.

35
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:33,523
Robb Stark will never
release the Kingslayer.

36
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:34,800
But his mother might.

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,232
How would you like to see
your beloved Cat again?

38
00:01:37,983 --> 00:01:40,382
- Outside!
- Come here, boy!

39
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:43,412
- Sweet boy, help us.
- Give it to me.

40
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:51,815
Round up any survivors.

41
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:53,859
We'll take them back
to Harrenhal.

42
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,819
We're looking for
a bastard named Gendry.

43
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,548
You want Gendry?
You already got him.

44
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,109
It's got to be the Mountain.
He's the biggest.

45
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:04,484
- He's the strongest.
- Bulls are bigger than lions.

46
00:04:04,504 --> 00:04:06,379
Doesn't mean I'd pick
a bull in a fight.

47
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:09,504
If the bull had fangs
and claws, I would.

48
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:13,254
Right, the Mountain
or our man Jaime.

49
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,796
If he ever gets out.

50
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,421
Loras Tyrell?

51
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:20,629
Loras Tyrell.
He's prettier than the queen.

52
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,213
I don't care about pretty.

53
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,816
He's better with a sword
than any of them.

54
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:25,459
How good could he be?

55
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:28,295
He's been stabbing
Renly Baratheon for years,

56
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,073
and Renly ain't dead.

57
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:41,838
The horses seem
a little spooked to you?

58
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,203
They're horses.

59
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:45,921
They get spooked
by their own shadows.

60
00:04:45,963 --> 00:04:47,065
Shh.

61
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,657
Do you hear that?

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:53,803
No.

63
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,867
There's something
out there.

64
00:05:20,393 --> 00:05:21,529
Oh.

65
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,262
Oh, you're a right
little prick.

66
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:26,279
You should see
your face.

67
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,375
I swear you
pissed yourself.

68
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,921
"Halt, who goes there?
Ahh!"

69
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:33,016
There is something out there.

70
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:34,923
Yeah, don't even try me.

71
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,546
- Rennick.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

72
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,504
Rennick!

73
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,670
- King in the North!
- The King in the North!

74
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:13,421
5 Lannisters dead
for every one of ours.

75
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:14,984
They're dead.
Take everything they've got.

76
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:17,170
We've nowhere to keep
all these prisoners.

77
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,671
Barely enough food
to feed our own.

78
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,818
We're not executing
prisoners, Lord Bolton.

79
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:23,421
Of course, Your Grace.

80
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:26,213
The officers
will be useful.

81
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:29,379
Some of them may be privy
to Tywin Lannister's plans.

82
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:31,171
I doubt it.

83
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:33,088
Well, we'll learn
soon enough.

84
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:37,046
In my family we say,
"A naked man has few secrets.

85
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,963
A flayed man none."

86
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:40,963
My father outlawed
flaying in the North.

87
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:44,213
- We're not in the North.
- We're not torturing them.

88
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:46,171
The high road's very pretty,

89
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:48,509
but you'll have a hard time
marching your army down it.

90
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,796
The Lannisters hold
prisoners of their own.

91
00:06:51,838 --> 00:06:55,004
I won't give them an excuse
to abuse my sisters.

92
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:57,129
No, no, don't! Don't!

93
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,859
- Shh, shh.
- Please!

94
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,031
Shh.

95
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,129
The rot's set in.

96
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:07,629
No, don't!
No, don't!

97
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,379
- Shh.
- Please, don't!

98
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:12,421
It'll get better.
It doesn't even hurt.

99
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,609
The rot will spread.
If we don't take the foot now--

100
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,266
No, you can't!

101
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:22,504
Ser! Please, Ser.

102
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,338
- I can't lose--
- You'll die if she does it.

103
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,213
I don't want to be
a cripple, please.

104
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:29,194
Surely one of our men needs your
attention more than this cub.

105
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:31,541
Your men are not
my men, My Lord.

106
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:34,296
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don't want to watch.

107
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:37,193
- No! You can't!
- Bite on it.

108
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:39,254
It's better than biting
your own tongue, believe me.

109
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:16,338
- What's your name?
- Talisa.

110
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,379
Your last name?

111
00:08:18,421 --> 00:08:20,629
You want to know what side
my family fights on?

112
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:22,725
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.

113
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:25,943
That boy lost his foot
on your orders.

114
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,088
They killed my father.

115
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,963
- That boy did?
- The family he fights for.

116
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:33,984
Do you think he's friends
with King Joffrey?

117
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:36,546
He's a fisherman's son
that grew up near Lannisport.

118
00:08:36,588 --> 00:08:37,796
He probably never held a spear

119
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:39,693
before they shoved one in his
hands a few months ago.

120
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:41,963
I have no hatred
for the lad.

121
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:45,588
That should help
his foot grow back.

122
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:52,213
You'd have us surrender,
end all this bloodshed.

123
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:55,344
I understand.
The country would be at peace

124
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:57,504
and life would be just
under the righteous hand

125
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:58,818
of good King Joffrey.

126
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:01,588
- You're going to kill Joffrey?
- If the Gods give me strength.

127
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,046
- And then what?
- I don't know.

128
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:07,004
We'll go back
to Winterfell.

129
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,046
I have no desire to sit
on the Iron Throne.

130
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,693
So who will?

131
00:09:11,713 --> 00:09:13,754
I don't know.

132
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,713
You're fighting
to overthrow a king,

133
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,546
and yet you have no plan
for what comes after?

134
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:19,471
First we have
to win the war.

135
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:27,379
You never told me
where you're from.

136
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:29,776
- Volantis.
- Volantis?

137
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:32,546
You're far from home.

138
00:09:32,588 --> 00:09:34,838
The boy was lucky
you were here.

139
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,963
He was unlucky
that you were.

140
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:48,859
You're here to answer for your
brother's latest treasons.

141
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,588
Your Grace,

142
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,921
whatever my traitor brother
has done, I had no part.

143
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:55,421
You know that.
I beg you--

144
00:09:55,463 --> 00:09:57,504
Ser Lancel, tell her
of this outrage.

145
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:59,796
Using some vile sorcery,

146
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:02,379
your brother fell on Stafford Lannister
with an army of wolves.

147
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:05,401
Thousands of good men
were butchered.

148
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:07,943
After the slaughter,
the northmen feasted on

149
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:09,671
the flesh of the slain.

150
00:10:11,713 --> 00:10:14,254
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

151
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:20,296
But my mother insists
on keeping you alive.

152
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:22,088
Stand.

153
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:25,484
So we'll have to send
your brother

154
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:27,504
a message some other way.

155
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,879
Meryn.

156
00:10:33,796 --> 00:10:36,504
Leave her face.

157
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:38,088
I like her pretty.

158
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:47,463
Meryn, My Lady
is overdressed.

159
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:50,088
Unburden her.

160
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,588
If you want Robb Stark
to hear us,

161
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,754
we're going to have
to speak louder.

162
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:03,796
What is the meaning
of this?

163
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,671
What kind of Knight
beats a helpless girl?

164
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:16,879
The kind who serves
his King, Imp.

165
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:18,338
Careful, now. We don't want

166
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,151
to get blood all over your
pretty white cloak.

167
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:23,296
Someone get the girl something
to cover herself with.

168
00:11:23,338 --> 00:11:25,526
She is to be your queen.

169
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:27,379
Have you no regard
for her honor?

170
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,588
- I'm punishing her.
- For what crimes?

171
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,901
She did not fight her
brother's battle, you half-wit.

172
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:35,504
You can't talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes!

173
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:37,401
The Mad King
did as he liked.

174
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:40,879
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told
you what happened to him?

175
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:43,838
No one threatens his Grace
in the presence of the Kingsguard.

176
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,921
I'm not threatening
the King, Ser.

177
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:47,504
I am educating my nephew.

178
00:11:47,546 --> 00:11:50,879
Bronn, the next time
Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.

179
00:11:52,048 --> 00:11:55,254
That was a threat.
See the difference?

180
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:20,546
I apologize for
my nephew's behavior.

181
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:23,504
Tell me the truth.

182
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,526
Do you want an end
to this engagement?

183
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:29,546
I am loyal to King Joffrey,
my one true love.

184
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:37,921
Lady Stark, you may
survive us yet.

185
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,338
The little king's
backed up.

186
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,390
Clogged from balls
to brains.

187
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:49,463
You think dipping his wick
will cure what ails him?

188
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:51,519
There's no cure
for being a cunt.

189
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,252
But the boy's at that age.

190
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:58,504
And he's got nothing to do all
day but pick wings off flies.

191
00:12:58,546 --> 00:13:01,088
Couldn't hurt to get
some of the poison out.

192
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:10,838
What are you
doing here, dog?

193
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,213
Your uncle left
your nameday present

194
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:15,713
and asked me to see
that you got it.

195
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:19,473
And?

196
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:21,724
What is it?

197
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:24,525
Look inside,
Your Grace.

198
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,565
Your Grace.

199
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:36,629
- Happy nameday, Your Grace.
- My nameday has passed.

200
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:38,665
We won't tell
if you won't.

201
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,773
No.

202
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:46,299
Her.

203
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:50,141
Touch her.

204
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:14,157
Could you hit her?

205
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,783
My uncle sent you?

206
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,379
Yes, Your Grace.

207
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:32,754
He chose us himself.

208
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,192
Hmm.

209
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:44,880
Use this.

210
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,838
Harder.

211
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:08,379
I said harder.

212
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,879
He'd want me to get
his money's worth.

213
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:59,296
Your Grace, too much pain
will spoil the pleasure.

214
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:04,129
Please, please

215
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,004
please, Your Grace.

216
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,046
Your Grace,
if your uncle finds out--

217
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:15,921
Oh, I want him
to find out.

218
00:16:15,963 --> 00:16:19,213
You will bring her to his
chambers when you're finished

219
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:21,463
and show him
what you've done.

220
00:16:23,254 --> 00:16:25,671
Or the same thing
will happen to you.

221
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,963
Begin.

222
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:43,671
Harder!

223
00:16:54,838 --> 00:16:58,421
Well, if it isn't
my favorite whoremonger.

224
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:01,379
Pray I haven't kept
you waiting long.

225
00:17:03,463 --> 00:17:05,588
Your Grace.

226
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:12,254
Now you do the Lannisters'
bidding, is that it?

227
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:15,463
Tell me, was my brother's
body even cold

228
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:17,671
before you secured
your newest patron?

229
00:17:17,713 --> 00:17:20,088
I'm a practical man.

230
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:23,379
Just not a loyal one.

231
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:25,359
And who would you have
me be loyal to?

232
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,338
Your brother's corpse?

233
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:32,546
I don't like you,
Lord Baelish.

234
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,901
I don't like your face.

235
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,338
I don't like the words that come
oozing out of your mouth.

236
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:41,943
I don't want you in my tent
1 minute more than necessary.

237
00:17:41,963 --> 00:17:45,171
So tell me,
why are you here?

238
00:17:46,171 --> 00:17:48,171
You can trust Brienne.

239
00:17:48,213 --> 00:17:50,713
Her loyalty comes
without charge.

240
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:55,921
You still have many friends
at court, Your Grace,

241
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:59,359
many who believe
Ned Stark erred

242
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:01,546
by not supporting
your claim.

243
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:05,713
Now I understand.

244
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,629
You know I have
the numbers.

245
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,421
You know I'm marching
on King's Landing.

246
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:13,629
When I take the throne,
you hope to retain your position.

247
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,088
And your head.

248
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,088
I would give priority
to my head.

249
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:22,588
I understand that
you don't like me,

250
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:24,963
and while that
saddens me greatly,

251
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,629
I did not come here today
seeking your affection.

252
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:31,151
When you march
on King's Landing,

253
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:34,588
you may find yourself facing
a protracted siege or...

254
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,838
open gates.

255
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:57,254
Your Grace.

256
00:18:57,296 --> 00:19:00,213
Lord Baelish.

257
00:19:00,254 --> 00:19:03,379
All of these tents
look the same to me.

258
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,754
- Would you be so kind--
- it would be my pleasure.

259
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:08,629
It took me weeks to learn
way around the camp.

260
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,693
Twice I walked in on officers
in stages of undress.

261
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:14,379
And the moment I learn
which tent is mine,

262
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,129
we're on the move again.

263
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,796
Your tent?

264
00:19:17,838 --> 00:19:19,963
Not our tent?

265
00:19:20,004 --> 00:19:22,379
The King snores, perhaps?

266
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:25,504
Or simply prefers
solitude?

267
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:28,421
Pressures of command,
no doubt.

268
00:19:28,463 --> 00:19:31,151
4 kings vying
for the throne.

269
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,546
I am not tutored
in warfare,

270
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:37,234
but basic arithmetic favors the
side with the greater numbers.

271
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:38,879
If war were arithmetic,

272
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:41,088
the mathematicians
would rule the world.

273
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,379
But I did notice your brother
entering his Grace's tent the just now.

274
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,629
The place of a Kingsguard
is by the King's side.

275
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,713
And on the night
of the your wedding,

276
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:52,463
who was by
the King's side then?

277
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:54,713
You seem quite interested
in our marriage.

278
00:19:54,754 --> 00:19:57,296
Your marriage
is quite interesting...

279
00:19:57,338 --> 00:20:00,463
Not only to me,
but to the realm.

280
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:03,588
The marriage of a wealthy girl
always breeds interest,

281
00:20:03,629 --> 00:20:05,754
if nothing else.

282
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:07,671
You've never married,
have you?

283
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:12,088
I've been unlucky
in my affections, sadly.

284
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:14,526
That is sad.

285
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,338
Though perhaps
it's for the best.

286
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,629
The whole notion of marriage
seems to confuse you,

287
00:20:18,671 --> 00:20:20,879
so allow me to explain.

288
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:25,338
My husband is my King,
and my King is my husband.

289
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:28,921
Here is your tent,
Lord Baelish. Good night.

290
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,296
What do you know
of this place?

291
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:28,463
Only that the desert
around their walls

292
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,629
is called
the Garden of Bones.

293
00:21:32,338 --> 00:21:35,254
Every time the Qartheen
shut their gates on a traveler,

294
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:37,504
the garden grows.

295
00:21:49,879 --> 00:21:52,879
- Go on!
- You, keep moving!

296
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:02,504
Bring her about!

297
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:05,504
What kind of fire
melts stone?

298
00:22:05,546 --> 00:22:07,443
Dragon fire.

299
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:09,213
There's dragons here?

300
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,838
No, all the dragons
are dead.

301
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,088
What's that smell?

302
00:22:15,754 --> 00:22:18,504
Dead people.

303
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,671
Move.

304
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:30,754
Please, please, no, no!

305
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:40,504
No.

306
00:22:50,088 --> 00:22:53,026
He's dead.

307
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:56,213
He was my son.

308
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:01,504
My sister
was 3 days ago.

309
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,588
My husband,
the day before that.

310
00:23:05,588 --> 00:23:07,879
They take someone
every day?

311
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:12,296
Does anyone live?

312
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:38,213
Joffrey.

313
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:40,213
Cersei.

314
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:42,004
Ilyn Payne.

315
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,943
The Hound.

316
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,338
Joffrey.

317
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:49,046
Cersei.

318
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,004
Ilyn Payne.

319
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:52,796
The Hound.

320
00:23:52,838 --> 00:23:56,004
Joffrey. Cersei.

321
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:59,088
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

322
00:24:03,213 --> 00:24:04,671
How dare you?

323
00:24:04,713 --> 00:24:06,546
You may have heard
false reports.

324
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:09,088
- You betrayed Ned.
- Betrayed?

325
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:11,068
I wanted him to serve
as Protector of the Realm.

326
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:12,629
I begged him
to seize the moment.

327
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:16,776
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.

328
00:24:16,796 --> 00:24:20,088
And you repaid our faith
with treachery.

329
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:21,421
- No, My Lady.
- Get out!

330
00:24:21,463 --> 00:24:23,629
Cat, I've--

331
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:26,296
I've loved you
since I was a boy.

332
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:30,213
It seems to me that fate
has given us this chance--

333
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:33,671
Have you lost your mind?
Get out!

334
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:49,254
Do you want to see
your girls again?

335
00:24:51,338 --> 00:24:55,109
Sansa, more beautiful
than ever.

336
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:59,171
And Arya,
just as wild as ever.

337
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:01,421
You have Arya, too?

338
00:25:01,463 --> 00:25:05,526
Both girls are healthy
and safe...

339
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,546
for now.

340
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:12,379
But you know the Queen
and you know Joffrey.

341
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:15,379
I fear for
their longevity

342
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:17,588
if they remain
in the capital.

343
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:40,879
What do you want?

344
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:45,546
The Lannisters will trade your
daughters for the Kingslayer.

345
00:25:45,588 --> 00:25:47,129
Of course they will.

346
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,838
Jaime Lannister
for two girls?

347
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:51,421
Robb will never agree
to those terms.

348
00:25:51,463 --> 00:25:53,776
I'm not bringing
these terms to him.

349
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:55,671
I'm bringing them
to you.

350
00:25:55,713 --> 00:25:58,296
You think I'd keep
secrets from my son?

351
00:25:58,338 --> 00:26:01,254
Robb has surprised them all
with his skills in battle,

352
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:03,213
but he's not a mother.

353
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:06,088
Consider it, Cat.

354
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,838
You may not get
another chance.

355
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:15,796
- I've brought you a gift.
- I don't want your gifts.

356
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:19,129
A token of Tyrion
Lannister's goodwill.

357
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:23,296
He wants you to understand
that this exchange of prisoners

358
00:26:23,338 --> 00:26:25,443
is offered in good faith.

359
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:27,421
Good faith?

360
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,213
What's this?

361
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:05,838
Your husband was
an honorable man.

362
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:09,588
He should rest beside his family
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

363
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:16,379
- You may not believe--
- get out.

364
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:51,921
Get up, you dogs!

365
00:28:02,421 --> 00:28:05,734
That's him,
the one who picks.

366
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:07,921
The Mountain.

367
00:28:10,546 --> 00:28:12,546
What are you doing?

368
00:28:12,588 --> 00:28:14,713
He told me he stares
at him every day.

369
00:28:14,754 --> 00:28:17,213
That's why he
doesn't get picked.

370
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:44,463
You.

371
00:28:44,504 --> 00:28:47,254
Move, boy!

372
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:49,754
Move!

373
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:10,401
Is there gold and silver
in the village?

374
00:29:10,421 --> 00:29:12,943
- I don't know.
- Gems?

375
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:15,171
I didn't see any.

376
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:17,588
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

377
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:36,254
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know. Please.

378
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:39,088
- Where is the Brotherhood?
- I don't know.

379
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:46,463
Which of the villagers
aided them?

380
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:49,088
- I don't know.
- Who?

381
00:29:49,129 --> 00:29:51,296
I--

382
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:56,671
- Who?
- I never saw.

383
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,338
- Who?
- I never saw.

384
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:01,484
Please. Please, stop.
Please, it's starting to--

385
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:04,838
- Who?
- I didn't see anyone help him.

386
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:07,254
Take it off! Take it off!

387
00:30:07,296 --> 00:30:09,671
- Who helped him?
- Ganes the butcher

388
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:11,546
- and his son.
- That's better.

389
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:14,796
- You've been very helpful.
- No, stop, please!

390
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:17,234
What are you doing?
Please, stop!

391
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:19,754
Please, stop!
No! No!

392
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:22,004
I told you everything!
No!

393
00:30:22,046 --> 00:30:25,338
No!

394
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:28,629
Joffrey.

395
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:30,754
Cersei.

396
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,254
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.

397
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:36,004
Please, Polliver.
Some food.

398
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:38,796
Just a crust of bread.

399
00:30:43,088 --> 00:30:45,068
Polliver.

400
00:30:45,088 --> 00:30:47,379
The Mountain.

401
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:07,463
Lady Stark, I had not thought
to find you in the Stormlands.

402
00:31:07,504 --> 00:31:11,046
I had not thought
to be here, Lord Stannis.

403
00:31:11,088 --> 00:31:14,463
- Can that truly be you?
- Who else might it be?

404
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:17,213
When I saw your standard,
I couldn't be sure.

405
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:19,796
- Whose banner is that?
- My own.

406
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:22,401
I suppose if we used
the same one,

407
00:31:22,421 --> 00:31:25,213
the battle would be
terribly confusing.

408
00:31:25,254 --> 00:31:27,463
Why is your stag
on fire?

409
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:30,296
The King has taken
for his sigil

410
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:32,338
the fiery heart
of the Lord of Light.

411
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:36,818
Ah, you must be this fire
priestess we hear so much about.

412
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:39,046
Mm, brother,

413
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:42,359
now I understand why you
found religion in your old age.

414
00:31:42,379 --> 00:31:43,838
Watch yourself, Renly.

415
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:46,879
No, no, I'm relieved.

416
00:31:46,921 --> 00:31:49,088
I never really believed
you're a fanatic.

417
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:52,463
Charmless, rigid,
a bore, yes,

418
00:31:52,504 --> 00:31:54,296
but not a godly man.

419
00:31:54,754 --> 00:31:57,046
You should kneel
he's the Lord's chosen,

420
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:01,421
born amidst salt
and smoke.

421
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:03,629
Born amidst salt
and smoke?

422
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,921
Is he a ham?

423
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:06,879
That's twice
I've warned you.

424
00:32:06,921 --> 00:32:08,818
Listen to yourselves.

425
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:12,088
If you were sons of mine, I
would knock your heads together

426
00:32:12,129 --> 00:32:13,796
and lock you in a bedchamber
until you remembered

427
00:32:13,838 --> 00:32:15,401
that you were brothers.

428
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:18,129
It is strange to find you
beside my brother, Lady Stark.

429
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:20,963
Your husband was a supporter
of my claim.

430
00:32:21,004 --> 00:32:23,046
Lord Eddard's integrity
cost him his head.

431
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:26,088
And you sit beside this pretender
and chastise me.

432
00:32:26,129 --> 00:32:27,796
We share a common enemy.

433
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:31,546
The Iron Throne
is mine by right.

434
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:35,004
All those that deny that
are my foes.

435
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:38,296
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

436
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,046
Old men deny it
with their death rattle

437
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,963
and unborn children deny it
in their mother's wombs.

438
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:47,193
No one wants you
for their King.

439
00:32:47,213 --> 00:32:50,421
You never wanted
any friends, brother.

440
00:32:50,504 --> 00:32:52,879
But a man without friends
is a man without power.

441
00:32:52,921 --> 00:32:56,463
For the sake of the mother
who bore us,

442
00:32:56,504 --> 00:32:58,879
I will give you this one night
to reconsider.

443
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:01,504
Strike your banners,

444
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,129
come to me before dawn,

445
00:33:04,171 --> 00:33:07,088
and I will grant you
your old seat in the council.

446
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:11,046
I'll even name you
my heir

447
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:12,921
until a son
is born to me.

448
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:17,254
Otherwise I shall
destroy you.

449
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:22,693
Look across
those fields, brother.

450
00:33:22,713 --> 00:33:25,359
Can you see
all those banners?

451
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,129
You think a few bolts
of cloth will make you King?

452
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:30,338
No.

453
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:33,504
The men holding those bolts
of cloth will make me King.

454
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:35,421
We shall see, Renly.

455
00:33:35,463 --> 00:33:38,171
Come the dawn,
we shall see.

456
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:40,379
Look to your sins,
Lord Renly.

457
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:42,921
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

458
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:52,046
Would you believe
I loved him once?

459
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:14,421
I thought we were welcome.

460
00:34:14,463 --> 00:34:17,318
If you heard a Dothraki horde
was approaching your city,

461
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:19,379
you might do the same,
Khaleesi.

462
00:34:21,754 --> 00:34:23,796
Horde?

463
00:34:38,504 --> 00:34:40,546
My name is Daenerys--

464
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:43,796
Daenerys Stormborn
of the House Targaryen.

465
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:45,879
You know me, My Lord?

466
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:48,546
Only by reputation,
Khaleesi.

467
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:52,129
And I'm no lord,
merely a humble merchant.

468
00:34:53,213 --> 00:34:55,838
They call you
the Mother of Dragons.

469
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,859
And what should
I call you?

470
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,463
Oh, my name is quite long

471
00:34:59,504 --> 00:35:02,046
and quite impossible
for foreigners to pronounce.

472
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:05,713
I am simply a trader
of spices.

473
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:09,068
But we are the Thirteen,

474
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:12,443
charged with the governance
and protection of Qarth,

475
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:16,171
the greatest city
that ever was or will be.

476
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:20,004
The beauty of
Quarth is legendary--

477
00:35:20,046 --> 00:35:22,046
Qarth.

478
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:25,129
Qarth.

479
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:28,213
Might we see
the dragons?

480
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:36,213
My friend,

481
00:35:36,254 --> 00:35:38,671
we have travelled
very far.

482
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:41,213
We have no food,
no water.

483
00:35:41,254 --> 00:35:43,713
Once I see my people fed,
I would be honored--

484
00:35:43,754 --> 00:35:46,588
Forgive me,
Mother of Dragons,

485
00:35:46,629 --> 00:35:50,609
but no man alive has seen
a living dragon.

486
00:35:50,629 --> 00:35:52,796
Some of my more
skeptical friends

487
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:56,296
refuse to believe
your children

488
00:35:56,338 --> 00:35:58,213
even exist.

489
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:01,671
All we ask is the chance
to see for ourselves.

490
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:03,671
I am not a liar.

491
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,713
Oh, I don't think you are.

492
00:36:05,754 --> 00:36:07,463
But as I've never
met you before,

493
00:36:07,504 --> 00:36:10,713
my opinion on the matter
is of limited value.

494
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,671
Where I come from,

495
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:17,171
guests are treated
with respect,

496
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:20,504
not insulted
at the gates.

497
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:23,046
Then perhaps you should
return to where you come from.

498
00:36:23,088 --> 00:36:25,296
We wish you well.

499
00:36:28,796 --> 00:36:30,671
What are you doing?

500
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:33,504
You promised
to receive me.

501
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,026
We have received you.

502
00:36:36,046 --> 00:36:38,754
Here we are,
and here you are.

503
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:42,713
If you do not let us in,
all of us will die.

504
00:36:42,754 --> 00:36:45,421
Which we shall
deeply regret.

505
00:36:45,463 --> 00:36:46,526
But Qarth did not become

506
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:48,671
the greatest city that
ever was or will be

507
00:36:48,713 --> 00:36:52,379
by letting Dothraki savages
through its gates.

508
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:01,504
Khaleesi, please
be careful.

509
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:06,921
Thirteen!

510
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:09,463
When my dragons are grown,

511
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,588
we will take back
what was stolen from me

512
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:14,963
and destroy those
who have wronged me.

513
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:17,463
We will lay waste
to armies

514
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:20,213
and burn cities
to the ground.

515
00:37:20,254 --> 00:37:24,213
Turn us away and we will
burn you first.

516
00:37:24,254 --> 00:37:26,421
Ah.

517
00:37:26,463 --> 00:37:29,213
You are a true
Targaryen.

518
00:37:29,254 --> 00:37:32,379
Only, as you said
a moment ago,

519
00:37:32,421 --> 00:37:34,004
if we don't let you
into the city,

520
00:37:34,046 --> 00:37:36,546
you will all die.
And so...

521
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,213
Retreating in fear
from a little girl

522
00:37:39,254 --> 00:37:41,421
is unbecoming
of the greatest city

523
00:37:41,463 --> 00:37:43,026
that ever was
or will be.

524
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:46,588
The discussion is over,
Xaro Xhoan Daxos.

525
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,629
The Thirteen have spoken.

526
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:51,401
I am one of the Thirteen

527
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:53,879
and I am still speaking.

528
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:56,234
The girl threatens to burn
our city to the ground

529
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:59,443
and you would invite her in
for a cup of wine?

530
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:01,546
She is the Mother
of Dragons.

531
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:04,879
Do you expect her to watch
her people starve

532
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:07,004
without breathing fire?

533
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:09,629
I believe we can allow
a few Dothraki

534
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:12,213
through our gates
without dooming our city.

535
00:38:12,254 --> 00:38:15,546
After all, here I am,

536
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:17,671
a savage from
the Summer Isles,

537
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,546
and Qarth still stands.

538
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:22,504
Our decision is final.

539
00:38:22,546 --> 00:38:24,671
Very well.

540
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:29,546
I invoke Soumai.

541
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:36,046
I will vouch for her,
her people,

542
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:39,463
and her dragons
in accordance with the law.

543
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:47,463
Be it on your head.

544
00:38:48,879 --> 00:38:51,838
Welcome to Qarth,
My Lady.

545
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:43,754
You.

546
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:54,629
Is there gold or silver
in the village?

547
00:39:54,671 --> 00:39:57,546
- I'm not from the village.
- Where is the Brotherhood?

548
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:00,213
I don't know
what that is.

549
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:33,754
You two, take Lord Lannister's
things to his quarters.

550
00:40:33,796 --> 00:40:35,379
What's this?

551
00:40:35,421 --> 00:40:38,088
We weren't expecting you
till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.

552
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:40,754
Evidently not.

553
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:44,609
Why are these prisoners
not in their cells?

554
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:47,004
Cells are overflowing,
My Lord.

555
00:40:47,046 --> 00:40:48,629
This lot won't be here long.

556
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:51,088
Don't need
no permanent place.

557
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:54,129
After we interrogate 'em,
we usually just...

558
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:58,504
Are we so well-manned
that we can afford to discard

559
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:01,338
able young bodies
and skilled laborers?

560
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:13,546
You,
do you have a trade?

561
00:41:14,463 --> 00:41:16,379
Smith, My Lord.

562
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:20,254
What are you looking at?
Kneel!

563
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,088
Kneel or I'll carve
your lungs out, boy.

564
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:27,421
He'll do no such thing.

565
00:41:27,463 --> 00:41:31,171
This one's a girl,
you idiot,

566
00:41:31,213 --> 00:41:32,546
dressed as a boy.

567
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:35,671
- Why?
- Safer to travel, My Lord.

568
00:41:35,713 --> 00:41:37,796
Smart.

569
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:39,713
More than I can say
for this lot.

570
00:41:39,754 --> 00:41:42,401
Get these prisoners
to work.

571
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:44,379
Bring the girl.

572
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,463
I need a new
cupbearer.

573
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,129
My Lord.

574
00:41:55,504 --> 00:41:57,504
Your visits
are too few, cousin.

575
00:41:57,546 --> 00:41:59,151
Her Grace,
the Queen Regent,

576
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:01,546
commands you to release
Grand Maester Pycelle.

577
00:42:01,588 --> 00:42:04,921
- Here's your warrant.
- So it is.

578
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:07,338
Will you take
a cup with me?

579
00:42:07,379 --> 00:42:09,838
I find that mulled wine
helps me sleep.

580
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:11,879
I am here
at her Grace's behest,

581
00:42:11,921 --> 00:42:14,068
not to drink
with you, Imp.

582
00:42:14,088 --> 00:42:16,963
If my sister was
so concerned for Pycelle,

583
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:19,213
I would have thought
she'd come herself.

584
00:42:19,254 --> 00:42:21,276
Instead she sends you.

585
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:22,754
What am I to make
of that?

586
00:42:22,796 --> 00:42:24,806
I don't care
what you make of it,

587
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:26,879
so long as you release
your prisoner immediately.

588
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:31,004
And you've received these
instructions directly from Cersei?

589
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:33,318
As I said several times.

590
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:36,254
And you've waited this long
to deliver the information?

591
00:42:36,296 --> 00:42:38,484
When the Queen Regent
gives me a command, I carry

592
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:40,504
it out without delay.

593
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:45,568
Cersei must have
great trust in you,

594
00:42:45,588 --> 00:42:47,796
allowing you
into her chamber

595
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:50,713
during the hour
of the wolf.

596
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:57,504
The Queen Regent has a great
many responsibilities.

597
00:42:57,546 --> 00:42:59,129
She often works
from dusk till dawn.

598
00:42:59,171 --> 00:43:01,504
She must be very glad
to have you helping her

599
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,879
from dusk till dawn.

600
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:06,921
Ah, lavender oil.

601
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:09,504
She always loved lavender oil,
even as a girl.

602
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:11,171
I am a Knight!

603
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:13,963
An anointed Knight, yes.

604
00:43:14,004 --> 00:43:16,546
Tell me, did Cersei
have you knighted

605
00:43:16,588 --> 00:43:20,171
before or after she took
you into her bed?

606
00:43:20,213 --> 00:43:22,838
What?
Nothing to say?

607
00:43:22,879 --> 00:43:24,754
No more warnings
for me, Ser?

608
00:43:24,796 --> 00:43:26,754
You will withdraw
these filthy accusations.

609
00:43:26,796 --> 00:43:28,338
Have you ever given
any thought

610
00:43:28,379 --> 00:43:30,276
to what King Joffrey
will have to say

611
00:43:30,296 --> 00:43:33,713
when he finds out you've
been bedding his mother?

612
00:43:37,296 --> 00:43:39,171
It's not my fault!

613
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:41,879
Did she take you
against your will?

614
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:43,921
Can you not defend
yourself, Knight?

615
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:47,193
Your own father, Lord Tywin,
when I was named the King's squire,

616
00:43:47,213 --> 00:43:49,171
he told me to obey her
in everything.

617
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:51,068
Did he tell you
to fuck her, too?

618
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:54,338
I only meant
I did as I was bid.

619
00:43:54,379 --> 00:43:56,129
Hated every
moment of it,

620
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:58,171
is that what you'll
have me believe?

621
00:43:58,213 --> 00:44:00,254
A high place in court,
a knighthood,

622
00:44:00,296 --> 00:44:02,504
my sister's legs spreading
open for you at night.

623
00:44:02,546 --> 00:44:04,879
Oh, yes, it must
have been terrible.

624
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:06,921
Wait here. His Grace will want
to hear this.

625
00:44:06,963 --> 00:44:09,213
Mercy!
Mercy, My Lord! I beg you.

626
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:10,838
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.

627
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,609
My Lord, it was
your sister's bidding--

628
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:13,693
the Queen.

629
00:44:13,713 --> 00:44:15,588
I'll leave the city
at once, I swear.

630
00:44:15,629 --> 00:44:18,838
- No, I think not.
- My Lord?

631
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:20,838
You heard me.

632
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:25,901
My father told you
to obey my sister.

633
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:27,359
Obey her.

634
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:30,754
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.

635
00:44:30,796 --> 00:44:32,838
Pleasure her
whenever she requires.

636
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,943
No one ever need know

637
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,421
as long as you keep
faith with me.

638
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:41,921
I want to know
what Cersei is doing,

639
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:44,818
where she goes,
who she sees,

640
00:44:44,838 --> 00:44:47,254
what they talk of--
everything.

641
00:44:47,296 --> 00:44:49,296
And you will tell me.

642
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:51,693
Yes, My Lord, I will.

643
00:44:51,713 --> 00:44:54,046
I swear it,
as you command.

644
00:44:57,296 --> 00:44:59,588
Oh, rise, rise.

645
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:02,796
Let us drink to
our understanding.

646
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:05,379
Oh, you don't have
a cup. Oh, well.

647
00:45:05,421 --> 00:45:08,463
Smile, cousin. My sister
is a beautiful woman.

648
00:45:08,504 --> 00:45:10,129
And it's all for
the good of the realm.

649
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:12,776
Go back and tell her
that I beg her forgiveness,

650
00:45:12,796 --> 00:45:14,879
that I want no more
conflict between us

651
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,651
and that henceforth

652
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,651
I shall do nothing
without her consent.

653
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:19,963
But her demands.

654
00:45:20,004 --> 00:45:22,629
Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.

655
00:45:22,671 --> 00:45:24,879
- You will?
- Yes, I'll release him in the morning.

656
00:45:24,921 --> 00:45:26,859
Cersei can keep him
as a pet if she wants,

657
00:45:26,879 --> 00:45:28,879
but I will not have him
on the council.

658
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:31,754
I could swear that I had not
harmed a single hair on his head,

659
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:35,296
but that would not,
strictly speaking, be true.

660
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:49,588
Stay within
one table length.

661
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:56,546
Your Grace.

662
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:03,421
Do your knucklebones
bring you luck?

663
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,338
Well, life's been good since you
hacked them off, Your Grace.

664
00:46:09,379 --> 00:46:11,754
And it's four less
fingernails to clean.

665
00:46:11,796 --> 00:46:14,338
- Fewer.
- Pardon?

666
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:17,296
Four fewer
fingernails to clean.

667
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:20,671
Never understood
why you had to wear them.

668
00:46:20,713 --> 00:46:23,671
It reminds me of where I
come from and where I am now.

669
00:46:25,129 --> 00:46:26,754
It reminds me
of your justice.

670
00:46:26,796 --> 00:46:28,296
It was an honest
punishment

671
00:46:28,338 --> 00:46:29,859
and you were good
with the cleaver.

672
00:46:29,879 --> 00:46:32,546
You were a hero
and a smuggler.

673
00:46:32,588 --> 00:46:36,026
A good act does not
wash out the bad,

674
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:38,921
nor a bad to good.

675
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,421
A lesson I've tried
to teach my son.

676
00:46:41,463 --> 00:46:43,568
- Does he listen?
- To me?

677
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:46,254
Gods, no.

678
00:46:46,296 --> 00:46:49,088
But if your red woman told him
to leap from the crow's nest--

679
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:51,421
She has a name.

680
00:46:54,213 --> 00:46:56,838
I trust you've not forgotten
your smuggler's tricks.

681
00:46:59,129 --> 00:47:01,151
I've lived within
the law for 17--

682
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:03,588
I want you to be
a smuggler this time.

683
00:47:03,629 --> 00:47:06,193
Any shore, any night.

684
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:07,963
What am I bringing
ashore?

685
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:09,838
The red woman.

686
00:47:11,546 --> 00:47:13,713
No one must know
what you do

687
00:47:13,754 --> 00:47:15,338
and we'll not speak
of this again.

688
00:47:15,379 --> 00:47:18,921
I am true to Your Grace
and always will be,

689
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:21,921
but surely there are
other ways, cleaner ways.

690
00:47:21,963 --> 00:47:24,379
Cleaner ways
don't win wars.

691
00:47:54,129 --> 00:47:57,088
Are you afraid,
onion knight?

692
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:00,568
Someone once told me

693
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:03,004
the night is dark and
full of terrors.

694
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:07,379
You've carried more
unpleasant cargo in your time.

695
00:48:11,296 --> 00:48:14,213
Are you a good man,
Ser Davos Seaworth?

696
00:48:14,254 --> 00:48:16,213
I'd say my parts
are mixed, My Lady--

697
00:48:17,046 --> 00:48:18,109
good and bad.

698
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,629
If half an onion
is black with rot,

699
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:22,588
it's a rotten onion.

700
00:48:22,629 --> 00:48:25,296
A man is good
or he is evil.

701
00:48:25,338 --> 00:48:27,213
- And which are you?
- Oh, good.

702
00:48:27,254 --> 00:48:30,546
I'm a Knight myself
of sorts,

703
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:33,421
a champion of light
and life.

704
00:48:33,463 --> 00:48:36,629
Well, that must be
very nice for you.

705
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:57,004
- Do you love your wife?
- I do.

706
00:48:57,046 --> 00:48:59,338
Yet you have known
other women.

707
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:01,213
Don't talk about my wife.

708
00:49:01,254 --> 00:49:05,213
I'm not. I'm talking about
other women.

709
00:49:05,254 --> 00:49:07,629
Like me, Ser Davos.

710
00:49:11,879 --> 00:49:13,796
You want me.

711
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:16,796
You want to see
what's beneath this robe.

712
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:20,588
And you will.

713
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,171
Strange that
this Lord of Light

714
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:31,088
asks you to work
in the shadows.

715
00:49:31,129 --> 00:49:34,379
Shadows cannot live
in the dark, Ser Davos.

716
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,921
They are servants
of light,

717
00:49:36,963 --> 00:49:39,379
the children of fire.

718
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:42,859
And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.

719
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,713
These weren't here before.
They've barred the passage.

720
00:49:47,213 --> 00:49:49,504
They can't bar
our passage.

721
00:49:54,921 --> 00:49:56,421
Gods protect us.

722
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:59,963
There's only one God,
Ser Davos,

723
00:50:00,004 --> 00:50:02,713
and he only protects
those who serve him.

1
00:00:04,535 --> 00:00:05,568
Bigger.

2
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:07,265
- How much longer?
- A few more days.

3
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:10,005
I found something
at the Fist of the First Men.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,240
What does it do?

5
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:13,742
I'm not sure that
it does anything.

6
00:00:13,777 --> 00:00:15,477
You're not supposed to be here.

7
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:17,212
- If your father knew--
- He said you're a traitor.

8
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:18,413
I am, child.

9
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:20,348
You must get bored down here.

10
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,682
I brought you
something to read.

11
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:23,251
My lady, I can't
read the words.

12
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:24,619
I wouldn't know where to start.

13
00:00:24,654 --> 00:00:27,122
At the beginning.
This word is Aegon.

14
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:29,659
The Yunkish train
bed slaves, not soldiers.

15
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:32,395
- We can defeat them.
- But they won't meet us on the field.

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,531
<i>They have strong walls.<i>

17
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,273
Women in our position
must make the best

18
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,775
of our circumstances.

19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,678
How do I make the best
of my circumstances?

20
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,380
I have to marry him.

21
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,949
I didn't ask for this marriage.

22
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:51,919
I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.

23
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:55,089
My feelings for you
have not changed.

24
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:57,092
Listen to me, my lady.

25
00:00:57,126 --> 00:00:59,995
I'm not your lady.
I'm your whore.

26
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:03,165
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,968
You are mad.
We have powerful friends.

28
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:09,172
Friends who would take great
pleasure in destroying you.

29
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:11,475
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

30
00:01:13,778 --> 00:01:15,512
He said he had
powerful friends.

31
00:01:15,546 --> 00:01:16,813
Who was he talking about?

32
00:01:16,848 --> 00:01:19,149
- I don't know.
- Find out.

33
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,585
Haven't you ever wondered
where your strength came from?

34
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,255
- Your blood is noble.
- I'm just a bastard.

35
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,758
The bastard of Robert
of the House Baratheon.

36
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:29,261
There is power
in a king's blood.

37
00:01:29,295 --> 00:01:30,328
You're a liar!

38
00:01:30,363 --> 00:01:31,997
You lied to Gendry,
you lied to me.

39
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:33,332
Now--

40
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,567
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl!

41
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,409
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

42
00:01:42,443 --> 00:01:44,845
Won't do you no good.

43
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:17,501
I'll give you one try, girl.

44
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:22,206
Kill me and you're free.

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,976
But if I live,
I'll break both your hands.

46
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,047
Go on, hit me.

47
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:32,783
<i>Hit me hard.<i>

48
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:44,727
Sulk all you want.

49
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:47,630
The truth is, you're lucky.

50
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:51,434
You don't want to be
alone out here, girl.

51
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,069
Someone worse than me
would find you.

52
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:55,651
There's no one worse than you.

53
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,975
Ha, you never knew my brother.

54
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,544
He once killed a man
for snoring.

55
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,114
There's plenty worse than me.

56
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,649
There's men who like
to beat little girls,

57
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:07,718
men who like to rape them.

58
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,854
I saved your sister
from some of them.

59
00:05:11,757 --> 00:05:13,157
You're lying.

60
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:15,259
Ask her, if you
ever see her again.

61
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:16,994
Ask her who came back for her

62
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,864
when the mob
had her on her back.

63
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,301
They would have
taken her every which way

64
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,836
and left her there
with her throat cut open.

65
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:33,545
Is that the Blackwater?

66
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:36,014
The Blackwater?

67
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:38,382
Where do you think
I'm taking you?

68
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:43,121
Back to King's Landing
to Joffrey and the queen.

69
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,890
Fuck Joffrey.
Fuck the queen.

70
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:47,826
That's the Red Fork.

71
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,328
I'm taking you to the Twins.

72
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,565
But why?

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,268
Because your mother
and brother will be there

74
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,403
and they'll pay me for you.

75
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,908
Why would they be at the Twins?

76
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:06,813
Those outlaws you
love so much never told you?

77
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,482
The whole countryside
is yapping about it.

78
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:14,020
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

79
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:16,055
So quit trying
to bash my skull in

80
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,725
and we might just make it there
in time for the wedding.

81
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:39,577
Men who fight for gold have
neither honor nor loyalty.

82
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:41,179
<i>They cannot be trusted.<i>

83
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:43,848
<i>They can be trusted to
kill you if they're well paid.<i>

84
00:06:43,883 --> 00:06:46,151
<i>The Yunkish</i>
<i>are paying them well.<i>

85
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:47,919
You know these men?

86
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:50,621
Only by the broken swords
on their banners.

87
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:53,457
They're called the Second Sons.

88
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:56,393
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero,

89
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:59,062
"The Titan's Bastard."

90
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:01,464
Is he more titan or bastard?

91
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,767
He's a dangerous man, khaleesi.

92
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,836
They all are.

93
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,173
How many?

94
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,776
<i>2,000, Your Grace.<i>

95
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,478
<i>Armored and mounted.<i>

96
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:15,714
Enough to make a difference?

97
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,353
It's hard to collect
wages from a corpse.

98
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:25,190
I'm sure the sellswords prefer
to fight for the winning side.

99
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:27,225
I imagine you're right.

100
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,496
I'd like to talk to the Titan's
Bastard about winning.

101
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:33,599
He may not agree to meet.

102
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,067
He will.

103
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,804
A man who fights for gold can't
afford to lose to a girl.

104
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,407
<i>Your Grace,</i>
<i>allow me to present<i>

105
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:44,409
<i>the captains</i>
<i>of the Second Sons--<i>

106
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:47,445
Mero of Braavos,

107
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,548
Prendahl na Ghezn,

108
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,017
and...

109
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,552
Daario Naharis.

110
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,791
You are the Mother of Dragons?

111
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,729
I swear I fucked you once
in a pleasure house in Lys.

112
00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:07,498
- Mind your tongue.
- <i>Why?<i>

113
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:09,935
I didn't mind hers.

114
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,871
She licked my ass
like she was born to do it.

115
00:08:15,676 --> 00:08:18,511
You, slave girl, bring wine.

116
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,847
We have no slaves here.

117
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:22,882
You'll all be slaves
after the battle

118
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,018
unless I save you.

119
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,456
Take your clothes off and
come and sit on Mero's lap

120
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,258
and I may give you
my Second Sons.

121
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:34,161
Give me your Second Sons
and I may not have you gelded.

122
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:37,364
Ser Barristan, how many men
fight for the Second Sons?

123
00:08:37,398 --> 00:08:39,833
Under 2,000, Your Grace.

124
00:08:39,868 --> 00:08:41,535
We have more, don't we?

125
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,104
<i>10,000 Unsullied.<i>

126
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,139
I'm only a young girl,
new to the ways of war,

127
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,208
but perhaps a seasoned
captain like yourself

128
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:51,679
can explain to me how you
propose to defeat us.

129
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:54,548
I hope the old man is better with
a sword than he is with a lie.

130
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,552
You have 8,000 Unsullied.

131
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,923
You're very young
to be a captain.

132
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:04,559
He's not a captain.
He's a lieutenant.

133
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:06,628
Even if your numbers are right,

134
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:08,963
you must admit the odds
don't favor your side.

135
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:11,032
The Second Sons have faced
worse odds and won.

136
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,801
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

137
00:09:15,437 --> 00:09:16,972
Or you could fight for me.

138
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:21,976
We've taken the slavers' gold.

139
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,745
We fight for Yunkai.

140
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,048
<i>I would pay</i>
<i>you as much and more.</i>

141
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,218
Our contract is our bond.

142
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,752
If we break our bond,

143
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,955
no one will hire
the Second Sons again.

144
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:37,225
Ride with me and you'll
never need another contract.

145
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,661
You'll have gold and castles
and lordships of your choosing

146
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:42,263
when I take back
the Seven Kingdoms.

147
00:09:42,297 --> 00:09:44,799
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.

148
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,501
You have no cavalry.

149
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:49,070
A fortnight ago, I had no army.

150
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:51,439
A year ago, I had no dragons.

151
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:56,043
You have 2 days to decide.

152
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:02,016
Show me your cunt. I want to see
if it's worth fighting for.

153
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:10,590
You seem to be
enjoying my wine.

154
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:13,126
Perhaps you'd like
a flagon to help you ponder.

155
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,961
Only a flagon?

156
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:17,029
And what are my brothers
in arms to drink?

157
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,698
- A barrel, then.
- Good.

158
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:23,168
The Titan's Bastard
does not drink alone.

159
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:27,874
In the Second Sons,
we share everything.

160
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:30,309
After the battle,
maybe we'll all share you.

161
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,917
I'll come looking for you
when this is over.

162
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,222
Ser Barristan,

163
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:47,193
if it comes to battle,
kill that one first.

164
00:10:47,227 --> 00:10:49,362
Gladly, Your Grace.

165
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,884
Half Robert, half lowborn.

166
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,421
Show the boy to his chambers.

167
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:51,725
<i>Have the maids draw him a bath and
find him some decent clothes.<i>

168
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,928
I'll come visit you soon.

169
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:04,438
What do you mean
to do with him?

170
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,107
You know what I mean
to do with him.

171
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,275
Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

172
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,978
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don't torture the boy.

173
00:12:11,013 --> 00:12:13,314
Have you ever slaughtered
a lamb, my king?

174
00:12:13,348 --> 00:12:15,182
No.

175
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:18,285
If the lamb sees the knife,

176
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,387
she panics.

177
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,556
Her panic seeps into her meat,

178
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,825
darkens it, fouls the flavor.

179
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,227
You've slaughtered many lambs?

180
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,330
And none have seen the blade.

181
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:43,510
"And tho-- and thowg...

182
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,314

Vhag--"

187
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,027
Fuck me.

188
00:13:02,997 --> 00:13:06,732
<i>"Visenya Targaryen<i>

195
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:41,032
Your Grace.

196
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,934
They feeding you enough?

197
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,703
<i>2 meals a day.<i>

198
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:47,038
Cold for breakfast,
hot for supper.

199
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:48,873
I cannot complain.

200
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:52,110
You don't belong
in a place like this.

201
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:55,246
Well, it's sad to say,
but I've seen worse.

202
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:57,882
Yeah.

203
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:03,021
I'm sorry about your son.

204
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:06,358
<i>Didn't get the chance</i>
<i>to tell you before.<i>

205
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:09,595
Good lad.
Loyal lad.

206
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:15,868
Melisandre's returned.

207
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:18,171
I didn't know she'd been gone.

208
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,340
Came back with a bastard boy.

209
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,844
Robert's bastard boy.

210
00:14:23,878 --> 00:14:25,712
Why?

211
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:28,548
She says there's power
in king's blood.

212
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:31,651
She's going to kill him.

213
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:33,019
Sacrifice him.

214
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:34,588
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

215
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:37,857
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

216
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,626
The boy is your nephew.

217
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,128
What of it?
We're at war.

218
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:45,065
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

219
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:48,068
Robert bedded
one drunken night?

220
00:14:48,102 --> 00:14:50,104
Because he has
your blood in his veins.

221
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:55,043
So did Renly.

222
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:57,312
Renly wronged you.

223
00:14:57,346 --> 00:15:00,082
Renly declared himself king when
the throne belonged to you.

224
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:02,584
He raised an army,
stole your bannermen.

225
00:15:02,619 --> 00:15:04,787
This boy has done you no harm.

226
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,490
- He's an innocent.
- How many boys live in Westeros?

227
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:11,094
How many girls? How many men?
How many women?

228
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:13,362
The darkness will devour
them all, she says.

229
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:15,298
The night that never ends.

230
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,267
Unless I triumph.

231
00:15:17,301 --> 00:15:18,802
I never asked for this.

232
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,537
No more than I asked
to be king.

233
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,941
We do not choose our destiny,

234
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:26,510
but we must do our duty, no?

235
00:15:26,544 --> 00:15:29,279
Great or small,
we must do our duty.

236
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:34,618
What's one bastard boy
against a kingdom?

237
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:39,957
Your Grace,

238
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:42,092
why did you come
to see me today?

239
00:15:42,126 --> 00:15:44,861
I came to free you.

240
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:48,565
If you swear never to raise your
hand to the Lady Melisandre again.

241
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,767
I swear it.

242
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,070
I can't swear never
to speak against her.

243
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:56,139
You have little regard
for your own life.

244
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:58,241
Quite little, Your Grace.

245
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:00,643
Verging on none.

246
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:04,480
You could have freed me
yesterday or tomorrow,

247
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:07,150
but you came to me now before
this boy is put to the knife

248
00:16:07,184 --> 00:16:10,987
because you knew
I'd counsel restraint.

249
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:15,324
You came to hear me say it
because you believe it yourself.

250
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,793
You're not a man
who slaughters innocents

251
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,229
for gain or glory.

252
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:27,270
When my son was 5
he said to me,

253
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:29,772
"I don't ever
want to die."

254
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:33,108
I wanted to say to him, "You won't, child.
You won't ever."

255
00:16:33,142 --> 00:16:38,079
<i>I hated the idea of him lying
waiting in the dark, afraid<i>

256
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:43,785
I think mothers and fathers
made up the gods

257
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:46,988
because they wanted their children
to sleep through the night.

258
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,025
I saw a vision in the flames.

259
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,130
A great battle in the snow.

260
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,966
I saw it.

261
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:04,172
And you saw whatever
she gave birth to.

262
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:08,010
<i>I never believed,</i>
<i>but when you see the truth,<i>

263
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:10,579
when it's right there
in front of you

264
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,181
as real as these iron bars,

265
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:16,251
how can you deny
her god is real?

266
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,742
Little dragon bitch.
She talks too much.

267
00:17:39,776 --> 00:17:41,477
You talk too much.

268
00:17:41,511 --> 00:17:44,080
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

269
00:17:44,114 --> 00:17:46,782
8,000 Unsullied stand
between her and your cock.

270
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,585
My cock will find a way.

271
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,655
Tell him. Is there any place
that my cock can't reach?

272
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,291
She'll tell me whatever
you pay her to tell me.

273
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,627
Daario Naharis, the whore
who doesn't like whores.

274
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,697
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

275
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:04,700
And I'm no whore, my friend.

276
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,036
She sells her sheath
and you sell your blade.

277
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,538
- What's the difference?
- I fight for beauty.

278
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,073
For beauty?

279
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:12,674
We fight for gold.

280
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:17,046
The gods gave men two gifts to
entertain ourselves before we die--

281
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,982
the thrill of fucking a woman
who wants to be fucked

282
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:23,352
and the thrill of killing
a man who wants to kill you.

283
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:24,887
You'll die young.

284
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:26,488
<i>What do we do</i>
<i>about the dragon girl?<i>

285
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,358
We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied
on the battlefield.

286
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:32,094
There won't be a battle. And we don't
have to deal with her eunuchs.

287
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:33,629
We only have to deal with her.

288
00:18:33,663 --> 00:18:36,231
- She's well guarded.
- <i>Tonight's a new moon.<i>

289
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:39,868
One of us slips into her camp past
her Unsullied and her knights.

290
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,539
Which one of us?

291
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,508
Close your eyes, love.

292
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,083
Three coins.

293
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,985
A coin from Meereen,

294
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,254
a coin from Volantis,

295
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,856
and a coin from Braavos.

296
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,557
The Braavosi does the deed.

297
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:09,130
One for each of us, darling.

298
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,033
No peeking.

299
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,584
Do you hear me?

300
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:33,120
Follow my voice.
I'm right here.

301
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,490
You have something for me?

302
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:42,897
Valar morghulis.

303
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:06,654
Lady Sansa.

304
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,058
You look very handsome,
my lord.

305
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,659
Oh, yes.

306
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,095
The husband of your dreams.

307
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,764
But you do look glorious.

308
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,771
Perhaps we could have
a moment alone.

309
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,440
Do you mind?

310
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:30,645
Podrick, could you escort
Lady Stark's handmaiden?

311
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:48,165
My lady,

312
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,734
I want you to know

313
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,103
I didn't ask for this.

314
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:55,839
I hope I will not
disappoint you, my lord.

315
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:57,574
No, don't.

316
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,544
You don't have to speak to me
as a prisoner anymore.

317
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:02,579
You won't be a prisoner
after today.

318
00:21:02,614 --> 00:21:04,682
You'll be my wife.

319
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:09,087
I suppose that's a
different kind of prison.

320
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:12,758
I just wanted to say--

321
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:16,429
I'm just trying
to say very badly--

322
00:21:17,965 --> 00:21:20,333
I just--

323
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:23,168
just want to say
I know how you feel.

324
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:28,406
I doubt that
very much, my lord.

325
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,876
You're right.

326
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,245
I have no idea how you feel.

327
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,547
And you have no idea
how I feel.

328
00:21:43,688 --> 00:21:46,623
But I promise you
one thing, my lady.

329
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:50,327
I won't ever hurt you.

330
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,733
Do you drink wine?

331
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:59,303
When I have to.

332
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:02,573
Well, today you have to.

333
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:11,849
<i>You look
radiant, Your Grace.<i>

334
00:22:11,883 --> 00:22:14,485
Radiant?
Why radiant?

335
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:16,354
It's the word
that came to mind.

336
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,425
We're going to be sisters soon.

337
00:22:20,459 --> 00:22:22,861
We should be friends.

338
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:25,430
You're a musical girl,
aren't you?

339
00:22:25,465 --> 00:22:28,300
I imagine you have
a lovely voice.

340
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:31,270
A better dancer than a
singer, I'm afraid.

341
00:22:31,304 --> 00:22:33,872
Ah, but you know the song
"The Rains of Castamere"?

342
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:37,410
Of course. They play it
so often here at court.

343
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:40,413
So you know the story
of House Reyne of Castamere?

344
00:22:40,447 --> 00:22:42,915
Not as well as you, I'm sure.

345
00:22:42,949 --> 00:22:45,083
House Reyne
was a powerful family.

346
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:46,518
Very wealthy.

347
00:22:46,552 --> 00:22:49,087
The second wealthiest
in Westeros.

348
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:53,491
Aren't the Tyrells the second
wealthiest family in Westeros now?

349
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:55,960
Of course, ambitious
climbers don't want to stop

350
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:58,295
on the second highest rung.

351
00:22:58,329 --> 00:23:01,164
If only you could take
that final step,

352
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:04,067
you'd see further
than all the rest.

353
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:07,070
You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

354
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:10,040
So Lord Reyne built a castle

355
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:12,042
as grand as Casterly Rock.

356
00:23:12,076 --> 00:23:13,644
He gave his wife diamonds

357
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:16,213
larger than any
my mother ever wore.

358
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:18,582
And finally one day,

359
00:23:18,617 --> 00:23:20,951
he rebelled against my father.

360
00:23:20,986 --> 00:23:23,654
Do you know where
House Reyne is now?

361
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,222
Gone.

362
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:27,524
Gone.

363
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,794
A gentle word.

364
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:32,329
Why not say slaughtered?

365
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:35,232
Every man, woman, and child

366
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:37,735
put to the sword.

367
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,804
I remember seeing
their bodies hanging

368
00:23:39,838 --> 00:23:42,473
high above the gates
of Casterly Rock.

369
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:45,410
My father let them rot
up there all summer.

370
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:47,845
It was a long summer.

371
00:23:47,879 --> 00:23:51,515
"And now the rains
weep o'er their halls,

372
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,617
and not a soul to hear."

373
00:23:59,223 --> 00:24:00,824
If you ever
call me sister again,

374
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,493
I'll have you strangled
in your sleep.

375
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,926
What are you doing?

376
00:24:36,961 --> 00:24:38,695
Your father's gone.

377
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:41,831
As the father of the realm,

378
00:24:41,866 --> 00:24:45,268
it is my duty to give you
away to your husband.

379
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:09,789
You may now cloak the bride

380
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:12,892
and bring her
under your protection.

381
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,925
Could you...

382
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,834
Thank you.

383
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,810
Your Grace, Your Grace,

384
00:26:59,844 --> 00:27:02,412
<i>my lords, my ladies,<i>

385
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,616
<i>we stand here in the sight</i>
<i>of gods and men<i>

386
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,052
<i>to witness the union</i>
<i>of man and wife.<i>

387
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:12,956
<i>One flesh, one heart, one soul,<i>

388
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:15,893
now and forever.

389
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,210
Have you ever seen one like it?

390
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:38,179
I've never seen anything
like any of this.

391
00:27:38,213 --> 00:27:39,880
Not in my life.

392
00:27:39,915 --> 00:27:41,649
It's shocking, isn't it,

393
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,751
the first time
you encounter real wealth?

394
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:47,721
When I was your age, I lived
on one bowl of stew a day.

395
00:27:47,756 --> 00:27:50,658
And stew is a kind word for it.

396
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:54,529
In Flea Bottom we called
them bowls of brown.

397
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:58,633
We'd pretend that the meat
in them was chicken.

398
00:27:59,735 --> 00:28:01,770
We knew it wasn't chicken.

399
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:16,519
Here, taste this.

400
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:19,089
You think I'm trying
to poison you?

401
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:42,777
That's good.

402
00:28:46,348 --> 00:28:47,982
That's really good.

403
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:50,317
<i>Where do you think it's from?<i>

404
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:52,086
I couldn't even guess.

405
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,854
Doesn't matter, does it?

406
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:56,057
It's the real thing
or it's not.

407
00:28:56,091 --> 00:28:59,260
You only need a tongue
to tell the difference.

408
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,631
Go on, have some more.

409
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,571
You still don't trust it.

410
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:12,173
You think this is all a mistake

411
00:29:12,207 --> 00:29:14,909
and that you'll have to pay
somehow for every bite you take.

412
00:29:14,943 --> 00:29:17,278
That thought had
crossed my mind, yeah.

413
00:29:19,081 --> 00:29:21,415
There are no mistakes.

414
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,384
Not for us.

415
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,987
I'm a mistake.

416
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:29,223
I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

417
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:31,191
instead of the girl
next to her in the tavern.

418
00:29:31,226 --> 00:29:34,928
Your father chose your mother because
the Lord of Light willed it.

419
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:37,731
He willed it so you
could be here right now

420
00:29:37,765 --> 00:29:39,999
with a power inside you

421
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:43,035
you can't even begin
to understand.

422
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:48,141
And He brought me here
to draw it from you

423
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,143
and birth it into the world.

424
00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:55,381
We're both a part of His plan.

425
00:29:56,383 --> 00:29:58,050
He wants this for us.

426
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:00,920
No, He demands this of us.

427
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:07,260
I don't understand.
This--

428
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:09,095
this doesn't seem
very religious.

429
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:11,597
According to whom?

430
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,067
The Silent Sisters?

431
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:17,035
With their stern looks,

432
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,372
muzzled mouths,
and dried-up cunts?

433
00:30:21,841 --> 00:30:24,342
What have their gods
done for you?

434
00:30:24,377 --> 00:30:26,377
Hmm?

435
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:28,146
When you pray to them,

436
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,414
what's their answer?

437
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:33,017
A god is real or he's not.

438
00:30:34,252 --> 00:30:36,887
You only need eyes to see.

439
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:44,561
Death is coming
for everyone and everything.

440
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:47,564
A darkness that will
swallow the dawn.

441
00:30:48,633 --> 00:30:52,436
And we can stop it, you and I.

442
00:31:19,164 --> 00:31:22,733
Let me show you
what you have inside you.

443
00:31:22,768 --> 00:31:24,802
Come fight death with me.

444
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:56,235
What are you doing?

445
00:31:59,306 --> 00:32:01,340
You have to trust me.

446
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,065
What--?

447
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:28,501
Get it away.

448
00:32:28,535 --> 00:32:29,902
Get it off me.

449
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:32,705
Don't fight, don't fight.
They won't take much.

450
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:35,742
Why are you doing this?

451
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:39,746
I told you there's power
in the blood of kings.

452
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:41,749
And you have so much blood.

453
00:32:41,783 --> 00:32:44,818
No. No, no, no, no!

454
00:32:46,621 --> 00:32:49,023
Not there.
Not there!

455
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:56,663
You can blame Ser Davos.

456
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:59,332
He didn't believe in
the power of king's blood.

457
00:33:01,335 --> 00:33:03,603
He wanted a demonstration.

458
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:06,807
<i>Please.</i>
<i>Please, Your Grace.<i>

459
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:09,310
<i>My lord!<i>

460
00:33:50,617 --> 00:33:53,119
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.

461
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:59,826
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

462
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,646
So their son
will be your nephew.

463
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,282
After you're wed
to Cersei, of course.

464
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:28,621
And you will be
the king's stepfather

465
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:30,957
and brother-in-law.

466
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:32,858
When you marry the king,

467
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:36,762
<i>Joffrey's mother will</i>
<i>become his sister-in-law<i>

468
00:34:36,797 --> 00:34:40,866
<i>and your son</i>
<i>will be Loras' nephew?<i>

469
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:44,636
Grandson?
I'm not sure.

470
00:34:44,671 --> 00:34:47,206
But your brother will become
your father-in-law.

471
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:49,475
That much is beyond dispute.

472
00:35:10,162 --> 00:35:12,497
Will you pardon me, my lord?

473
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,234
Of course. Of course.
En-- enjoy.

474
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:23,874
Perhaps you could talk
to your bride-to-be instead.

475
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:29,012
I've got a lifetime for that.

476
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:42,226
Stay.

477
00:35:50,635 --> 00:35:53,070
You seem rather drunk.

478
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:55,907
Rather less than I plan to be.

479
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:58,810
Isn't it a man's duty to be
drunk at his own wedding?

480
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,411
This isn't
about your wedding.

481
00:36:00,446 --> 00:36:02,747
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.

482
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:05,050
Your wife needs a child,

483
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:08,086
a Lannister child,
as soon as possible.

484
00:36:08,121 --> 00:36:10,923
- And?
- If you're going to give her one,

485
00:36:10,957 --> 00:36:12,958
you need to perform.

486
00:36:12,992 --> 00:36:15,861
What did you once call me?

487
00:36:15,896 --> 00:36:18,364
A drunken little
lust-filled beast.

488
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:20,967
- More than once.
- <i>There you have it.<i>

489
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:23,069
Nothing to worry about.

490
00:36:23,103 --> 00:36:25,404
Drinking and lust,

491
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,073
no man can match me
in these things.

492
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:31,376
I am the god of tits and wine.

493
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:34,846
I shall build
a shrine to myself

494
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,781
at the next brothel I visit.

495
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:40,218
You can drink, you can joke,

496
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:42,653
you can engage
in juvenile attempts

497
00:36:42,687 --> 00:36:44,455
to make your father
uncomfortable,

498
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:47,291
but you will do your duty.

499
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,833
Well...

500
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:33,807
My father once told me--

501
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:37,077
Nobody cares what
your father once told you.

502
00:37:59,135 --> 00:38:01,670
Congratulations, my lady.

503
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:03,138
Thank you, Your Grace.

504
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:05,774
Well, you've done it.
You've married a Lannister.

505
00:38:05,808 --> 00:38:07,709
Soon you'll have
a Lannister baby.

506
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,946
It's a dream come true
for you, isn't it?

507
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,848
What a glorious day.

508
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:14,349
Yes, Your Grace.

509
00:38:14,384 --> 00:38:16,785
I suppose it doesn't
really matter

510
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:19,321
which Lannister
puts the baby into you.

511
00:38:20,456 --> 00:38:22,424
Maybe I'll pay you
a visit tonight

512
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,893
after my uncle passes out.

513
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,795
How'd you like that?

514
00:38:29,131 --> 00:38:30,866
You wouldn't?

515
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,902
That's all right. Ser Meryn and
Ser Boros will hold you down.

516
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:40,209
Time for the bedding ceremony.

517
00:38:41,478 --> 00:38:43,246
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

518
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,081
Where's your respect
for tradition, Uncle?

519
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,616
Come, everyone.

520
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:49,919
Pick her up and carry her
to her wedding bed.

521
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,689
Get rid of her gown. She won't
be needing it any longer.

522
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:56,626
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He's not heavy.

523
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,494
There will be
no bedding ceremony.

524
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:01,731
There will be if I command it.

525
00:39:03,534 --> 00:39:06,470
Then you'll be fucking
your own bride

526
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:09,607
with a wooden cock.

527
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:13,577
What did you say?

528
00:39:17,115 --> 00:39:21,819
What did you say?!

529
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:25,489
I believe we can dispense
with the bedding, Your Grace.

530
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:29,993
<i>I'm sure Tyrion did not mean</i>
<i>to threaten the king.<i>

531
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:40,035
A bad joke, Your Grace.

532
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,639
Made out of envy
of your own royal manhood.

533
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:47,543
Mine is so small.

534
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:50,413
My poor wife won't
even know I'm there.

535
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:53,783
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

536
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:56,219
<i>I am.<i>

537
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:58,454
Guilty.

538
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:01,357
But--

539
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,294
but it is my wedding night.

540
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:09,499
My tiny drunk cock
and I have a job to do.

541
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:13,936
Come, wife.

542
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:19,775
I vomited on a girl once

543
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:21,277
in the middle of the act.

544
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:22,945
Not proud of it.

545
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,882
But I think honesty
is important

546
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:28,452
between a man and wife,
don't you agree?

547
00:40:28,486 --> 00:40:30,955
Come, I'll tell you
all about it.

548
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:33,024
Put you in the mood.

549
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:07,225
Is that wise, my lord?

550
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:10,027
Tyrion, Sansa.

551
00:41:10,062 --> 00:41:12,129
My name is Tyrion.

552
00:41:13,164 --> 00:41:15,132
Is that wise, Tyrion?

553
00:41:20,104 --> 00:41:22,372
Nothing was ever wiser.

554
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:36,785
Astoundingly long.

555
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:38,853
What?

556
00:41:38,888 --> 00:41:40,655
Neck.

557
00:41:40,689 --> 00:41:42,490
You have one.

558
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,162
How old are you exactly?

559
00:41:47,196 --> 00:41:49,431
14.

560
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:57,439
Well, talk won't
make you any older.

561
00:42:04,514 --> 00:42:08,184
My lord father has commanded me

562
00:42:08,219 --> 00:42:10,787
to consummate this marriage.

563
00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:31,171
Stop.

564
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:34,608
I can't.

565
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:40,214
I could, I won't.

566
00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:41,649
But your father--

567
00:43:41,683 --> 00:43:44,251
If my father wants
someone to get fucked,

568
00:43:44,285 --> 00:43:46,486
I know where he can start.

569
00:43:51,658 --> 00:43:53,559
I won't share your bed.

570
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:59,231
Not until you want me to.

571
00:44:01,668 --> 00:44:04,570
What if I never want you to?

572
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:17,750
And so my watch begins.

573
00:45:11,905 --> 00:45:13,338
19?

574
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:14,640
Yes, Your Grace.

575
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:17,609
How can anyone
speak 19 languages?

576
00:45:17,644 --> 00:45:20,979
It only took Your Grace a year to
learn Dothraki reasonably well.

577
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:23,215
Yes, well, it was
either learn Dothraki

578
00:45:23,249 --> 00:45:26,285
or grunt at my husband
and hope--

579
00:45:27,654 --> 00:45:29,856
what do you mean
reasonably well?

580
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:34,261
Dothraki is difficult
for the mouth to master.

581
00:45:34,295 --> 00:45:36,396
So guttural and harsh.

582
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:47,907
<i>Athjahakar.<i>

583
00:45:47,942 --> 00:45:50,477
Athjahaka.

584
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:52,912
Ath-ja-hakar.

585
00:45:52,947 --> 00:45:55,614
Athjahakar.

586
00:45:56,816 --> 00:46:00,419
Well, I suppose
I'm a bit out of practice.

587
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:03,722
Your High Valyrian
is very good, Your Grace.

588
00:46:03,757 --> 00:46:07,192
The gods could not devise
a more perfect tongue.

589
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:10,129
<i>It is the only proper</i>
<i>language for poetry.<i>

590
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:18,504
No screaming or she dies.

591
00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:33,219
What do you want?

592
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:36,289
You.

593
00:46:36,323 --> 00:46:37,857
Let her go.

594
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:40,126
Don't scream, lovely girl.

595
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,234
You were sent here to kill me?

596
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:53,104
So why haven't you?

597
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:54,639
I don't want to.

598
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:57,641
What do your captains
have to say about that?

599
00:46:57,676 --> 00:46:59,910
You should ask them.

600
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:06,550
Why?

601
00:47:06,584 --> 00:47:09,319
We had philosophical
differences.

602
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:11,722
- Over what?
- Your beauty.

603
00:47:11,756 --> 00:47:14,692
<i>It meant more to me</i>
<i>than it did to them.<i>

604
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:16,694
You're a strange man.

605
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:18,729
I'm the simplest man
you'll ever meet.

606
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:20,264
I only do what I want to do.

607
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:22,200
And this is supposed
to impress me?

608
00:47:22,234 --> 00:47:24,535
Yes.

609
00:47:26,171 --> 00:47:29,107
Why would I trust a man
who murders his comrades?

610
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:31,543
They ordered me to murder you.

611
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:33,745
<i>I told them I preferred not to.<i>

612
00:47:33,779 --> 00:47:36,147
<i>They told me I had no choice.<i>

613
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:38,250
I told them
I am Daario Naharis.

614
00:47:38,284 --> 00:47:41,119
I always have a choice.

615
00:47:42,322 --> 00:47:45,024
They drew their swords

616
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:47,159
and I drew mine.

617
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,758
Will you fight for me?

618
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,535
Swear to me.

619
00:48:32,272 --> 00:48:35,275
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

620
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:38,145
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

621
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:40,648
my heart is yours.

622
00:48:58,501 --> 00:49:01,269
You really ought to knock.

623
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:03,572
I brought your breakfast.

624
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:23,115
It's getting dark.

625
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:25,317
We could stay here
for the night.

626
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:00,857
How hard can it be
to build a fire?

627
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,259
It doesn't matter.

628
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:05,728
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.

629
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,516
He winked at me before.

630
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:32,354
- I doubt it.
- I saw him wink at me.

631
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:34,756
He blinked.

632
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:37,592
I suppose it's a rather
philosophical difference

633
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:39,727
between a wink and a blink.

634
00:51:40,595 --> 00:51:42,263
A what?

635
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:47,902
Well, I mean,
there's no real difference.

636
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:52,974
A wink is on purpose.

637
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,646
You thought of a name yet?

638
00:52:00,983 --> 00:52:04,520
It would be easier to refer
to him if he had a name.

639
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:07,723
Sometimes do you talk fancy
on purpose to confuse me?

640
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:10,426
What? No.

641
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,163
This is just the way I talk.

642
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,502
I'll build that fire.

643
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:29,279
Don't you think
he should have a name?

644
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:33,584
I don't know many boys' names.

645
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:35,185
Let's see,

646
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,354
there's Duncan,

647
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:40,357
Kevan, Jon...

648
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:42,292
Guymon,

649
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,560
Feldan, Tristifer.

650
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:47,296
Craster.

651
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,231
Uh, yes.

652
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,067
Maybe that's not--

653
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,102
Mormont.

654
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:56,571
That's a lovely idea,

655
00:52:56,605 --> 00:52:58,539
but Mormont's a last name.

656
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:01,475
Why is it a last name?

657
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:04,212
Well, it's a family name.

658
00:53:06,081 --> 00:53:08,883
For instance,
I'm Samwell Tarly.

659
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:11,186
Samwell is my birth name

660
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,589
and Tarly is my family name.

661
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:19,093
You see? So my father
is also a Tarly.

662
00:53:20,396 --> 00:53:22,697
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?

663
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:25,634
No, Randyll Tarly.

664
00:53:25,668 --> 00:53:27,703
Randyll is a handsome name.

665
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,740
Please don't name him Randyll.

666
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,879
Is your father cruel like mine?

667
00:53:41,453 --> 00:53:43,854
Different manner of cruel.

668
00:53:56,735 --> 00:53:58,402
Not Randyll, then.

669
00:54:21,493 --> 00:54:23,628
Don't.

670
00:54:23,662 --> 00:54:25,463
Don't go out there.

671
00:54:25,497 --> 00:54:27,431
I'll be back.

672
00:54:27,466 --> 00:54:29,467
I just want to look.

673
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:06,970
Go inside.

674
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,339
Go back inside.
I'll--

675
00:55:23,088 --> 00:55:25,789
It's come for the baby.

676
00:55:40,972 --> 00:55:42,206
Stay back!

677
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,448
You stay back!

678
00:56:03,419 --> 00:56:06,195
No, you can't
have him! No!

679
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,399
No!

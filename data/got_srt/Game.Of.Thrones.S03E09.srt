1
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:05,703
<i>and three-eyed ravens</i>
<i>and black magic?

2
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:08,057
I don't want you talking to him
till we get to Castle Black.

3
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:10,741
We're not going to Castle Black.
Jon Snow isn't there.

4
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:12,536
Bran needs to find
the raven beyond the Wall.

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,212
Oh, no, I'm not
going back there.

6
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,382
I promised your maester I'd get you
to Castle Black and no further.

7
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,985
You won't win.
You don't have the discipline.

8
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,154
- You don't know how to fight together.
- You don't know that.

9
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,857
If you attack the Wall
you'll die, all of you.

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,625
All of us.

11
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,095
I can't force them
to meet us in the field.

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,565
- Casterly Rock can't run away.
- Can you do it?

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,434
There is only one person
in this kingdom

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,004
with that kind of army.
Walder Frey.

15
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,907
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

16
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:43,410
Our father requires Lord Edmure
to wed one of his daughters.

17
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:46,113
- You were sent here to kill me?
- I don't want to.

18
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:48,148
What do your captains
have to say about that?

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,818
<i>You should ask them.<i>

20
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,187
Will you fight for me?

21
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,257
The Second Sons are yours
and so is Daario Naharis.

22
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:58,326
My sword is yours,
my life is yours,

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,094
my heart is yours.

24
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:03,665
- Is that the Blackwater?
- Where do you think I'm taking you?

25
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,234
- Back to King's Landing.
- That's the Red Fork.

26
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:07,769
I'm taking you to the Twins.

27
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,438
Your uncle's marrying
one of the Frey girls.

28
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:12,607
Your mother and brother
will be there

29
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:14,576
and they'll pay me for you.

30
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,879
That rain will cost
us another day.

31
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:19,515
Lord Frey will take
this delay as a slight.

32
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,184
- He's getting the wedding he wanted.
- He's getting a wedding.

33
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:24,187
<i>It was a king he wanted.<i>

34
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,622
It's come for the baby.

35
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:27,924
You stay back!

36
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:32,495
No, you can't have him.

37
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,264
<i>No!</i>

38
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:52,871
<i>Are you sure about this?<i>

39
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:55,574
No.

40
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:57,643
It's dangerous.

41
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,247
If we take Tywin's
castle from him,

42
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:05,550
the lords of Westeros will
realize he's not invincible.

43
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:07,052
Take his home,

44
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,187
take his gold, take his power.

45
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,323
Why are you telling me?

46
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:16,861
You begged me not to send Theon

47
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:20,799
to negotiate with his father
and I ignored your advice.

48
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,137
Now Winterfell is burnt
to the ground,

49
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,339
the North is overrun
with ironborn,

50
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,441
and Bran and Rickon are gone.

51
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,845
So Casterly Rock...

52
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:40,151
I'm asking your advice.

53
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:48,426
We have enough men?

54
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,266
If Walder Frey cooperates.

55
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,269
If Walder Frey cooperates.

56
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:05,477
If reinforcements arrive
from King's Landing

57
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,879
<i>before we take the castle...<i>

58
00:05:09,248 --> 00:05:13,084
we'll be caught between
Tywin's army and the sea.

59
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:20,857
We'll lose the war and die
the way Father died.

60
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,892
Or worse.

61
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:31,734
Show them how it feels
to lose what they love.

62
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:04,533
<i>My honored guests...<i>

63
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,604
be welcome within my walls

64
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:10,439
and at my table.

65
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:15,144
<i>I extend to you my hospitality<i>

66
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:19,015
and protection
in the light of the Seven.

67
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,685
We thank you for your
hospitality, my lord.

68
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:28,525
I have come to make
my apologies, my lord,

69
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,427
and to beg your forgiveness.

70
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:33,830
Don't beg my forgiveness,
Your Grace.

71
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:38,368
It wasn't me you spurned.
It was my girls.

72
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:53,550
<i>One of them was supposed</i>
<i>to be queen.<i>

73
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,251
Now none of them are.

74
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:59,822
This is Arwyen my daughter.

75
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:04,460
<i>My daughter Walda,</i>
<i>my daughter Derwa,<i>

76
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:07,062
<i>my daughter Waldra.<i>

77
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:13,802
My eldest granddaughters

78
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:17,138
<i>Ginia and Neila.<i>

79
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:23,212
<i>Serra and Sarra,</i>
<i>granddaughters, twins.<i>

80
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:24,813
You could have had either.

81
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:28,117
<i>Could have had both</i>
<i>for all I care.<i>

82
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:30,585
My granddaughter Marianne.

83
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,488
<i>My granddaughter Freya.<i>

84
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:37,325
My granddaughter...

85
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,960
Wertha.

86
00:07:41,196 --> 00:07:44,264
<i>Waldra.<i>

87
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:46,300
Waldina.

88
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:49,136
- I'm Merry.
- Fine.

89
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,940
And here's my youngest
daughter Shirei,

90
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:55,911
<i>though she hasn't bled yet.<i>

91
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:58,814
Clearly you don't have
the patience for all that.

92
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,817
My ladies.

93
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:05,354
All men should keep their
word, kings most of all.

94
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:09,925
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

95
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,127
<i>The fault is not with you.<i>

96
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:15,564
<i>Any man would be lucky</i>
<i>to have any one of you.<i>

97
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,500
<i>I did what I did</i>
<i>not to slight you,<i>

98
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,369
but because I loved another.

99
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:22,304
<i>I know these words</i>
<i>cannot set right<i>

100
00:08:22,338 --> 00:08:24,372
<i>the wrong I have done</i>
<i>to you and your house.<i>

101
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:27,709
I beg your forgiveness

102
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:30,845
and pledge to do
all I can to make amends

103
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:33,715
so the Freys of the Crossing
and the Starks of Winterfell

104
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:35,683
may once again be friends.

105
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,893
<i>Very good.<i>

106
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,030
There she is.

107
00:08:49,065 --> 00:08:51,199
<i>Come closer.<i>

108
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:53,200
Let me have a look at you.

109
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:02,342
Still can't see you.

110
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,511
Old eyes.

111
00:09:19,228 --> 00:09:21,396
Love.

112
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,301
<i>That's what the Starks</i>
<i>of Winterfell call it, eh?<i>

113
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:29,438
Very honorable.

114
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,740
I call it a pretty face.

115
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:34,844
Mmm, very pretty.

116
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,048
Prettier than this lot,
that's for sure.

117
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:42,652
Very shapely as well.

118
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:47,357
<i>Oh, you try to hide her</i>
<i>under that dress.<i>

119
00:09:47,391 --> 00:09:49,359
If you wanted to hide her,

120
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:51,762
you shouldn't have brought her
here in the first place.

121
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:59,437
I can always see

122
00:09:59,471 --> 00:10:02,306
what's going on
beneath a dress.

123
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:05,243
<i>Been at this a long time.<i>

124
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:09,146
<i>I bet when you take</i>
<i>that dress off,<i>

125
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:11,882
everything stays
right where it is.

126
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:13,716
Doesn't drop an inch.

127
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:19,254
Your king says he betrayed
me for love.

128
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:22,024
I say he betrayed me
for firm tits

129
00:10:22,058 --> 00:10:24,660
and a tight fit.

130
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:27,362
And I can respect that.

131
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:32,400
When I was your age,
I'd have broken 50 oaths

132
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:35,869
to get into that
without a second thought.

133
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:42,676
Well, I've enough room
in the hall for you lot.

134
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,778
We'll set up tents outside

135
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:47,181
with food and ale
for the rest of your men.

136
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,383
Thank you, my lord.

137
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,222
Well, let's get ready.

138
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:56,291
The wine will flow red

139
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:59,795
<i>and the music will play loud<i>

140
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:04,033
and we'll put
this mess behind us.

141
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:14,743
Where?

142
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:16,378
There.

143
00:11:23,486 --> 00:11:26,355
There.
It's a back gate.

144
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,291
My men use it when they
visit Yunkai's bed slaves.

145
00:11:29,326 --> 00:11:31,027
Your men, but not you?

146
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:32,695
<i>I have no
interest in slaves.<i>

147
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,998
A man cannot make love
to property.

148
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:39,903
This is where
we enter the city.

149
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:41,405
Very few guards.
They know me.

150
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,940
They let me inside--

151
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:45,209
We're not gonna sneak
an army through a back gate.

152
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,213
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men

153
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:51,616
and lead them through the back
streets, which I know well,

154
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,751
and open the front gates.

155
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:55,386
Then comes the army.

156
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,055
Once the walls are breached,
the city will fall in hours.

157
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,993
Or perhaps you'll lead Grey
Worm and me to the slaughter,

158
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:03,495
cutting the head off our army.

159
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,265
<i>The masters of Yunkai</i>
<i>will pay you your fee<i>

160
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,667
and you won't have
to split it three ways

161
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,702
'cause you've already
slaughtered your partners.

162
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:12,205
You have
a very suspicious mind.

163
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,308
In my experience, only dishonest
people think this way.

164
00:12:17,845 --> 00:12:19,679
You command the Unsullied.

165
00:12:19,713 --> 00:12:22,082
<i>What do you think?<i>

166
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:36,062
You leave tonight.

167
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:38,197
Very good.

168
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:40,032
We'll prepare.

169
00:12:45,104 --> 00:12:46,738
Ser Jorah.

170
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,442
You can use an extra sword.

171
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:52,978
You're the Queensguard,
Ser Barristan.

172
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:55,047
Your place is by the queen.

173
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:57,516
If we are truly
her loyal servants,

174
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,585
we'll do whatever
needs to be done

175
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,756
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

176
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,329
We're west of Castle Black,

177
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:11,364
but the Nightfort's
closest to us.

178
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:14,534
It was the first
castle on the Wall.

179
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:17,970
The Watch abandoned it during
the reign of King Jaehaerys I.

180
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,674
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.

181
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,043
Other than Castle Black itself,

182
00:13:24,077 --> 00:13:26,545
the Nightfort's
the perfect castle for us.

183
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,049
It's got a secret sally port,

184
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:32,685
the Black Gate,
as old as the Wall itself.

185
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:36,455
No one's used it
in centuries most likely.

186
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:39,157
It leads through the Wall

187
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:41,092
right down into the Nightfort,

188
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:42,994
if one knows how to find it,

189
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,930
which, it just
so happens, I do.

190
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:53,270
How do you know all that?

191
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:57,241
I read about it
in a very old book.

192
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:04,314
You know all that

193
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:07,283
from staring at marks on paper?

194
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:10,353
Yes.

195
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:13,156
You're like a wizard.

196
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,342
Our father used to tell us

197
00:14:30,376 --> 00:14:34,747
that no wildling ever looked
upon the Wall and lived.

198
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:37,283
Here we are.

199
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:39,653
Alive.

200
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:58,671
Remember what happens
to children who run.

201
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,541
I'm your father
and I'll do the talking.

202
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,787
The roads have gone
right to hell, haven't they?

203
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,956
Cracked 3 spokes
this morning.

204
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,992
- Need a hand?
- Need about 8 hands.

205
00:15:18,026 --> 00:15:19,960
Oh!

206
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,162
Got to get this
salt pork to the Twins

207
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:24,798
in time for the wedding.

208
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,334
Many thanks.

209
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,071
Don't!

210
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,406
Don't kill him.

211
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,608
Dead rats don't squeak.

212
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,310
You're so dangerous,
aren't you?

213
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:38,378
Saying scary things
to little girls.

214
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,181
Killing little boys
and old people.

215
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:42,649
A real hard man you are.

216
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:44,651
More than anyone you know.

217
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:47,420
You're wrong.
I know a killer.

218
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,090
- A real killer.
- That so?

219
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,725
You'd be like a kitten to him.

220
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,094
He'd kill you
with his little finger.

221
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:56,229
That him?

222
00:15:57,598 --> 00:15:59,632
- No.
- Good.

223
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,602
Don't kill him.

224
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,904
Please.

225
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:07,073
Please don't.

226
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,777
You're very kind.

227
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,779
Someday it'll get you killed.

228
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,965
Where are we?

229
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:35,200
The Gift, I think.

230
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:36,869
Brandon the Builder
gave all this land

231
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:38,971
<i>south of the Wall</i>
<i>to the Night's Watch<i>

232
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:41,941
for their sustenance
and support.

233
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:44,244
Maester Luwin taught me that.

234
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,315
Doesn't seem to be supporting
anyone at the moment.

235
00:16:48,349 --> 00:16:52,052
It's good land
and there's no war up here.

236
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,587
Why leave?

237
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:55,322
Wildlings.

238
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:57,090
Sorry.

239
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:59,826
But they come over
the Wall and raid,

240
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,694
steal, carry off women.

241
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:03,929
Old Nan said they turn
your skull into a cup

242
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:06,031
and make you drink
your own blood from it.

243
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:10,402
That's what Old Nan said.

244
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:12,104
There's a storm coming.

245
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,774
I don't see any--

246
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,979
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

247
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,585
We can drink some blood
while we wait.

248
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:28,753
I don't need much.

249
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,002
Only one old man
and 8 good horses.

250
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,138
What's one old man
doing with 8 horses?

251
00:17:46,172 --> 00:17:48,039
He breeds them for the Watch.

252
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:50,042
How's he keep folks
from stealing them?

253
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:52,411
The Watch protects him.

254
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,680
Not today they don't.

255
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:57,384
He's selling horses,
he's got some gold in there.

256
00:17:57,418 --> 00:18:00,620
- <i>And proper steel.</i>
- Let's carve him up.

257
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:02,022
We just take the horses and go.

258
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:04,725
The old man's no threat.

259
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:07,194
I keep telling you.

260
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:09,363
He's an old man.

261
00:18:09,397 --> 00:18:11,865
A spear through the heart's
a better way to die

262
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:14,373
than coughing up your last with
no one but your horses to hear.

263
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:19,239
The Watch might send a few men
looking for a horse thief.

264
00:18:19,274 --> 00:18:22,142
They'll send a lot more
to hunt down murderers.

265
00:18:22,177 --> 00:18:24,011
I hope so.

266
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,981
Killing crows
in their castle is tough.

267
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:28,950
Killing them out here
in the open,

268
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:30,685
that's what we do.

269
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,453
Spread out.

270
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:35,056
Surround the hut and move in.

271
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,066
Ygritte!

272
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,637
<i>Clear the barn!<i>

273
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:04,210
No one's going to believe you're a
hog farmer if you eat them all.

274
00:20:04,278 --> 00:20:06,546
Best part of the animal.

275
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,454
Don't worry.
They're still there.

276
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,291
I know they're still there.

277
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:18,059
You check every 5 minutes

278
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,661
like you're afraid
they're gonna move.

279
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:22,463
I'm not afraid.

280
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:24,732
Of course you are.

281
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:27,068
You're almost there

282
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,704
and you're afraid
you won't make it.

283
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:33,141
The closer you get,
the worse the fear gets.

284
00:20:33,175 --> 00:20:36,612
No point in trying to hide
behind that face.

285
00:20:36,646 --> 00:20:39,548
<i>I know fear when I see it.<i>

286
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:41,450
Seen it a lot.

287
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:45,287
I knew fear
when I saw it in you.

288
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:49,559
You're afraid of fire.

289
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,328
When Beric's sword
went up in flames,

290
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:53,196
you looked like
a scared little girl.

291
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:59,169
And I know why, too.

292
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,474
<i>I heard what</i>
<i>your brother did to you.<i>

293
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,910
Pressed your face to the fire

294
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,546
like you're a nice
juicy mutton chop.

295
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:14,519
That give you some ideas?

296
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:20,025
Might do.

297
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,394
Go ahead, then.

298
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:24,796
You might get away.

299
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:27,366
Might even make it
there on your own.

300
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,669
They're just over the river.

301
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,838
The closest you've
been to family

302
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:35,907
since Ilyn Payne
snipped your daddy's neck.

303
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:42,347
Someday I'm gonna put
a sword through your eye

304
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:44,015
and out the back of your skull.

305
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:12,174
How are we going
to get past the Wall?

306
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:14,143
My uncle said
it's 700 feet high.

307
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:21,050
How did you get past it?

308
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:27,823
Got in a boat and rowed
past the Bay of Seals.

309
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:31,059
It would take us two months
to get to the Bay of Seals.

310
00:22:31,093 --> 00:22:33,228
Some climb straight up the ice.

311
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:36,564
Even Hodor's not strong enough to
climb the Wall with me on his back.

312
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:39,801
Hodor.

313
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,370
19 castles guard the Wall.

314
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:45,774
- Only 3 are still manned.
- Hodor!

315
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,043
One of those abandoned fortresses
will give us a way through.

316
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:50,312
My uncle said the gates were
sealed with ice and stone

317
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:51,780
when the castles were deserted.

318
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:55,117
Well, we'll have
to open them up again.

319
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,455
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- <i>There's a rider out there.<i>

320
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,692
Just one?

321
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:04,494
- <i>There's more.</i>
- Hodor!

322
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:07,363
Shh. Shh.

323
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:10,133
- It's just thunder, sweet giant.
- Hodor.

324
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:12,535
I yield.

325
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,237
- <i>I yield.</i>
- Wildlings.

326
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:20,845
Where's Shaggydog and Summer?

327
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,880
Hunting.

328
00:23:22,948 --> 00:23:24,916
Hodor!

329
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,251
- Shh, quiet, Hodor.
- Hodor!

330
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,286
Make him shut up.
If they hear us...

331
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,489
- Hush, Hodor. No-- no more Hodoring.
- Hodor!

332
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:34,425
- Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

333
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,793
- You need to keep quiet.
- They're gonna hear us.

334
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,995
<i>Hodor, be quiet.<i>

335
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,666
- Ah! Hodor!
- Hodor, calm down.

336
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:44,702
- Hodor! Hodor!
- Hodor, be quiet!

337
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,659
What did you do?

338
00:24:08,693 --> 00:24:11,428
Nothing.

339
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:13,397
I don't know.

340
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:19,103
What's that?

341
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:22,607
That's a horse dying.

342
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:35,252
<i>Bring them over here.<i>

343
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:38,455
<i>That was the last of them.
The rest are dead.<i>

344
00:24:38,489 --> 00:24:40,723
<i>I heard shouting up there.<i>

345
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:42,892
Thunder.

346
00:24:42,926 --> 00:24:45,494
I know the difference
between shouting and thunder.

347
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:48,663
Maybe it's ghosts.

348
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:00,909
That won't help you, grandpa.

349
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,948
Where you riding?

350
00:25:06,982 --> 00:25:08,983
Doesn't matter now, does it?

351
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:11,753
No, it doesn't matter now.

352
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:16,858
Cut his throat or he'll
tell the crows we're here.

353
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:24,499
You understand.

354
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,501
Let me stand at least.

355
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,938
<i>Let me go</i>
<i>with a bit of dignity.<i>

356
00:25:34,977 --> 00:25:36,678
Make the crow kill him.

357
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:43,619
You're one of us now.
Prove it.

358
00:25:47,825 --> 00:25:50,427
The wolves are out there.

359
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,065
I can't do it by choice.

360
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,137
I don't know how.
It happens in my dreams.

361
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,273
You're a warg, Bran.

362
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:03,375
It's in your blood.

363
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:04,877
I can't.

364
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,812
You just did with him.

365
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,848
A wolf is nothing
compared to that.

366
00:26:16,556 --> 00:26:18,290
She looks sharp.

367
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:29,970
Do it.

368
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:32,439
Do it.

369
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:35,608
I told you.
He's still one of them.

370
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,378
Go on, boy.

371
00:26:42,282 --> 00:26:43,582
Go on!

372
00:26:52,358 --> 00:26:54,159
He's a crow.

373
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:56,127
<i>He'll always be a crow.<i>

374
00:26:56,162 --> 00:26:58,529
And here's his crow wife
guarding him.

375
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:01,766
He'll stab us in the back
first chance he gets.

376
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:07,071
Kill him.

377
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:24,389
- He's one of them.
- No!

378
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:25,923
Do you hear me?

379
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:35,233
You're not gonna die
for one of them.

380
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:39,538
Do it.

381
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:41,406
They'll find us if you don't.

382
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,074
You were right the whole time.

383
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:40,633
Hyah!

384
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:02,322
<i>When you hear a
songbird's whistle, you come.<i>

385
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:06,126
I'm a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.

386
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:14,100
Daario Naharis.

387
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:44,363
<i>That one was quick.<i>

388
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,167
- There may be others.
- I doubt it.

389
00:29:49,202 --> 00:29:52,070
The Yunkish prefer to let their
slaves do their fighting for them.

390
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:39,987
That's what you call
a few guards?

391
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,381
Come on!
What do you got, huh?

392
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:23,156
Lord Edmure...

393
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:27,094
I hope I'm not
a disappointment to you.

394
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:38,106
You're a delight
to me, my lady.

395
00:32:39,742 --> 00:32:41,410
You may now cloak the bride

396
00:32:41,444 --> 00:32:43,512
and bring her under
your protection.

397
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,176
In the sight of the Seven,

398
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:17,880
I hereby seal these two souls,

399
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:21,517
binding them as one
for eternity.

400
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:24,487
<i>Look upon each other</i>
<i>and say the words.<i>

401
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:29,325
Father, Smith,

402
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:31,727
Warrior, Mother,

403
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:34,798
Maiden, Crone, Stranger...

404
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:36,933
- I am hers...
- I am his...

405
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:39,102
- <i>and she is mine...</i>
- <i>and he is mine...<i>

406
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:43,140
<i>...from this day</i>
<i>until the end of my days.<i>

407
00:33:47,846 --> 00:33:50,715
- Is that safe?
- They're long gone.

408
00:33:56,154 --> 00:33:57,687
You were right.

409
00:33:57,755 --> 00:34:00,256
I can get inside Summer's
mind whenever I want.

410
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:02,491
Of course you can.

411
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,093
North of the Wall
there are wildlings

412
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:08,129
who can control
all sorts of animals.

413
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:10,498
<i>But you did a lot</i>
<i>more than that.<i>

414
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:15,403
You got inside Hodor's mind.

415
00:34:15,437 --> 00:34:18,272
They can't do that
north of the Wall?

416
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,711
No one can do that...

417
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:23,846
<i>anywhere.<i>

418
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,155
When I was looking
through Summer's eyes,

419
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,856
- I saw Jon.
- Where?

420
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:36,658
He was with the wildlings.

421
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:38,727
They tried to kill him,
but he got away.

422
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:40,395
<i>He'll be heading back
to Castle Black, then.<i>

423
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,264
That's where we should go.

424
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:44,666
For all we know, Castle
Black's already under attack.

425
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:47,502
- If this many wildlings got through--
- I already told you.

426
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,538
I'm not going
north of the Wall.

427
00:34:49,572 --> 00:34:52,541
Everything Jojen
told me is true.

428
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:56,745
You saw what I did to Hodor.

429
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:58,747
<i>I have to find</i>
<i>the three-eyed raven.<i>

430
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:00,349
Listen to me, little lord.

431
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,616
Don't worry.

432
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,753
I'm not asking you
to come with me.

433
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,457
It won't be safe for Rickon.

434
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:11,561
Me?
I'm coming with you.

435
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:14,097
No.

436
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:16,766
You and Osha and Shaggydog
head for the Last Hearth.

437
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:20,003
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They'll protect you.

438
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:21,772
I'm coming with you.

439
00:35:21,806 --> 00:35:23,674
I'm your brother.

440
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,010
I have to protect you.

441
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:31,248
Right now I have
to protect you.

442
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:34,418
Robb's at war and I'm
going beyond the Wall.

443
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:36,821
If something happens to us,

444
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:38,923
you're the heir to Winterfell.

445
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:43,161
Would you know how
to find the Last Hearth?

446
00:35:43,195 --> 00:35:46,298
You southerners build your big
castles and you never move.

447
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:47,966
You're easy to find.

448
00:35:48,034 --> 00:35:50,736
We're not southerners.

449
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,839
And I don't want to leave you.

450
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:56,675
Shh, shh.
Come here, little soldier.

451
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:01,747
You and me, we're gonna
have some adventures.

452
00:36:01,782 --> 00:36:04,150
You don't have to do
any of this.

453
00:36:05,485 --> 00:36:06,952
Your family took me in

454
00:36:06,987 --> 00:36:09,322
and was good to me when
they had no cause to be.

455
00:36:09,356 --> 00:36:11,691
<i>Shh.<i>

456
00:36:11,725 --> 00:36:13,993
We'll be fine, you and me.

457
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:16,262
The Umbers are great warriors.

458
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:18,931
Even I heard
about them growing up.

459
00:36:18,966 --> 00:36:21,334
They'll teach you
how to swing a sword.

460
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:24,904
I know how to swing a sword.

461
00:36:31,811 --> 00:36:34,580
You're leaving now? It's
the middle of the night.

462
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:36,482
I learned to walk in darkness.

463
00:36:38,952 --> 00:36:40,653
Say your good-byes,
little man.

464
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:50,829
Keep this one safe.

465
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:54,665
He means the world to me.

466
00:37:15,756 --> 00:37:18,290
We've been waiting a long time.

467
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,328
Haven't we?

468
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,264
I don't know, you tell me.

469
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:27,500
How long does it take
to sack a city?

470
00:37:35,742 --> 00:37:37,843
It was just as you said.

471
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:41,279
They did not believe
until it was too late.

472
00:37:41,313 --> 00:37:43,314
Their slave soldiers

473
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:46,818
threw down their spears
and surrendered.

474
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:53,491
And Daario Naharis?

475
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:16,616
The city is yours, my queen.

476
00:38:39,741 --> 00:38:41,275
They're good, aren't they?

477
00:38:41,309 --> 00:38:43,043
They ought to be
because they cost enough.

478
00:38:50,252 --> 00:38:53,454
Look at the crowd there.

479
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,093
He complained
about this marriage

480
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,362
the entire ride from Riverrun,

481
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:02,897
<i>and now look at him.<i>

482
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:04,898
<i>The gods
love to reward a fool.<i>

483
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:07,434
- Uncle.
- What?

484
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:10,437
He's my nephew.
I love him.

485
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:12,473
And he's a damned fool.

486
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:20,247
Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?

487
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:22,583
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.

488
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:24,852
That's the point.

489
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:26,687
Didn't you marry
one of these Frey girls?

490
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:28,189
Aye.

491
00:39:28,223 --> 00:39:30,291
Lord Walder let me choose
any of his granddaughters

492
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:34,428
and promised me the girl's
weight in silver as a dowry.

493
00:39:34,496 --> 00:39:36,297
So I have a fat young bride.

494
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,301
I hope she makes you
very happy.

495
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:42,136
Well, she's made me very rich.

496
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:44,806
Pardon, my lord, my lady.

497
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,308
I need to find
a tree to piss on.

498
00:39:49,378 --> 00:39:51,713
My mother's alone
with Roose Bolton.

499
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,181
I should rescue her.

500
00:39:53,215 --> 00:39:55,149
Your mother is less
in need of rescue

501
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,151
than any woman I've ever met.

502
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,253
Be kind.

503
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:00,288
She's finally starting
to like you.

504
00:40:01,957 --> 00:40:03,758
And I like her.

505
00:40:03,793 --> 00:40:06,995
But if she had her way,
I would be back in Volantis

506
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:10,298
playing my harp and you
would be sitting over there

507
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,335
<i>eating blackberries</i>
<i>out of Roslin Frey's hand.<i>

508
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,537
Perhaps I've made
a terrible mistake.

509
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:21,343
Striking your king
is an act of treason.

510
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:26,449
No, don't.

511
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:29,018
Don't insult them.

512
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:33,689
Your Grace.

513
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:44,366
The septon has prayed
his prayers,

514
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,601
<i>some words were said,<i>

515
00:40:46,636 --> 00:40:48,436
and Lord Edmure

516
00:40:48,504 --> 00:40:51,405
has wrapped my daughter
in a cloak.

517
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,877
But they are not yet
man and wife.

518
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,480
A sword needs a sheath.

519
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,289
And a wedding needs a bedding.

520
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,191
What does my sire say?

521
00:41:10,226 --> 00:41:13,228
To bed! To bed! To bed!

522
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:20,936
If you think the time
is right, Lord Walder,

523
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,173
by all means, let us bed them.

524
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:34,450
To bed! To bed! To bed!

525
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,959
<i>Go on!<i>

526
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:03,747
Oh!
Careful now, ladies.

527
00:42:03,781 --> 00:42:05,815
Once you set that monster free,

528
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,618
there's no caging him again.

529
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,954
To bed! To bed! To bed!

530
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:17,293
Poor girl.

531
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:20,229
Every bride suffers the same.

532
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:22,865
I'm sure you endured
yours with grace.

533
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:25,401
Oh, Ned forbade it.

534
00:42:25,436 --> 00:42:28,638
He said it wouldn't be right if he broke
a man's jaw on our wedding night.

535
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:40,216
That is a very strange custom.

536
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:42,152
I suppose it does seem strange

537
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:43,853
from a foreigner's perspective.

538
00:42:43,888 --> 00:42:45,689
It seems normal to you?

539
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:48,125
It's a tradition.

540
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:52,829
Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

541
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,399
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

542
00:42:55,433 --> 00:42:58,769
But there are other ways
of providing proof.

543
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:02,906
Boy or girl?

544
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:06,978
I don't know.

545
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:10,181
But if it's a boy, I know
what we should name him.

546
00:43:10,215 --> 00:43:12,383
Oh, do you?

547
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:15,854
It seems to me the father should
have some say in his son's naming.

548
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:17,255
Eddard.

549
00:43:20,926 --> 00:43:22,961
Don't you want to teach
little Ned Stark

550
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:25,430
how to ride horses?

551
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:27,665
I do.

552
00:44:23,587 --> 00:44:25,755
<i>Go on, line 'em up!<i>

553
00:44:42,408 --> 00:44:44,810
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

554
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:49,615
Where are you going?

555
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,383
Got salt pork for the feast.

556
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:53,618
The feast is over.

557
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:56,054
<i>Doesn't sound
like it's over.<i>

558
00:44:56,088 --> 00:44:58,956
If I tell you
it's over, it's over.

559
00:44:58,991 --> 00:45:03,193
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

560
00:45:03,228 --> 00:45:05,195
Got pig's feet, too.

561
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:08,464
Are you soft in the head?

562
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:10,233
Turn this cart around.

563
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,513
Your Grace.

564
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:34,690
<i>I feel I've been remiss<i>

565
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:36,458
in my duties.

566
00:45:36,492 --> 00:45:40,196
<i>I've given you meat</i>
<i>and wine and music,<i>

567
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,898
<i>but I haven't shown you<i>

568
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:46,001
<i>the hospitality you deserve.<i>

569
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,638
<i>My king has married<i>

570
00:45:48,672 --> 00:45:52,108
<i>and I owe my new queen</i>
<i>a wedding gift.<i>

571
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:59,383
Robb!

572
00:46:46,195 --> 00:46:48,296
You ready to
head home to Winterfell, right?<i>

573
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:53,034
<i>Feast over yet, is it?<i>

574
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:55,570
Aye, it's over.

575
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:27,701
Follow him.

576
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,506
It's too late.

577
00:48:44,346 --> 00:48:47,448
The King in the North arises.

578
00:49:09,105 --> 00:49:11,306
Lord Walder!

579
00:49:11,374 --> 00:49:12,974
Lord Walder, enough!

580
00:49:13,008 --> 00:49:15,443
Let it end!

581
00:49:17,046 --> 00:49:19,080
Please.

582
00:49:19,147 --> 00:49:21,249
He is my son.

583
00:49:21,316 --> 00:49:23,584
<i>My first son.<i>

584
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:26,187
Let him go and I swear
that we will forget this.

585
00:49:26,222 --> 00:49:28,890
I swear it by
the old gods and new.

586
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,425
We will take no vengeance.

587
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,129
You already swore me one oath
right here in my castle.

588
00:49:34,164 --> 00:49:37,966
You swore by all the gods your
son would marry my daughter!

589
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:41,336
<i>Take me for a
hostage, but let Robb go.<i>

590
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:43,538
Robb, get up.

591
00:49:43,573 --> 00:49:45,307
Get up and walk out.

592
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:47,742
Please!

593
00:49:49,412 --> 00:49:52,147
Please!

594
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:56,018
And why would I
let him do that?

595
00:49:58,655 --> 00:50:01,390
On my honor as a Tully,

596
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,193
on my honor as a Stark,

597
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:07,096
let him go

598
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:10,233
or I will cut
your wife's throat.

599
00:50:18,709 --> 00:50:21,310
I'll find another.

600
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:26,549
Mother.

601
00:50:27,613 --> 00:50:29,318
The Lannisters send
their regards.

1
00:00:02,246 --> 00:00:05,268
I want you to tell me
the truth about Joffrey.

2
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:06,962
He's a monster.

3
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:09,057
With the Tyrells beside us,

4
00:00:09,082 --> 00:00:11,572
no one will think of rebelling
for another century.

5
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:18,646
It would be bad luck
to kill a man on your nameday.

6
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:20,348
You'll be my new fool.

7
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:21,333
Thank you, Your Grace.

8
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:22,609
Do you know what it takes

9
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:24,070
to unite

10
00:00:24,326 --> 00:00:26,655
I told them
we were all going to die.

11
00:00:26,678 --> 00:00:28,372
If we don't get out.

12
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:31,964
Let us go, my father will pay you
whatever you want.

13
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,827
Enough to buy me a new head?

14
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:52,351
We need to find
Sansa Stark a husband.

15
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,873
Tyrion will do as he's bid and
will marry Ser Loras.

16
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:57,477
- I am not some brood mare.
- You're my daughter!

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,864
My feelings for you
have not changed.

18
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,311
I'm not your lady,
I'm you whore.

19
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:04,495
He's a Crow.
He'll stab us in the back.

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,317
Kill him.

21
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,312
That's a fine little blade.

22
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:14,042
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.

23
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:15,682
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

24
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:16,897
You got to carry me.

25
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:21,505
Robb.

26
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:27,939
The Lannisters send
their regards.

27
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:33,289
Too late.

28
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,751
You know I didn't have a choice.

29
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:38,599
You know nothing,
Jon Snow.

30
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,537
Your home.

38
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,713
- Magnificent.
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:50,915
Looks fresh-forged.

40
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,349
It is.

41
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,486
No one's made a Valyrian
steel sword

42
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,088
since the Doom
of Valyria.

43
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:58,823
There are three
living smiths

44
00:05:58,857 --> 00:06:01,025
who know how to rework
Valyrian steel.

45
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:03,627
The finest of them
was in Volantis.

46
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:06,664
Came here to King's Landing
at my invitation.

47
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:08,899
Where did you get
this much Valyrian steel?

48
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:11,669
From someone who no longer
had need of it.

49
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:16,974
You've wanted one of these
in the family for a long time.

50
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:18,909
- And now we have two.
- Two?

51
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:21,479
The original weapon
was absurdly large.

52
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,881
Plenty of steel
for two swords.

53
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:26,951
Well, thank you.
It's glorious.

54
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,825
You'll have to train
your left hand.

55
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,361
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

56
00:06:37,395 --> 00:06:39,430
You'll never be as good.

57
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:41,165
No.

58
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,959
But as long as I'm better
than everyone else,

59
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,635
I suppose
it doesn't matter.

60
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:47,872
You can't serve in the Kingsguard
with one hand.

61
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,241
Where's that written?
I can and I will.

62
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,442
The Kingsguard oath
is for life.

63
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:53,644
The war is over.
The king is safe.

64
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,379
The king is never safe.

65
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:57,915
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

66
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,384
Other knights protected the king
while you were a prisoner.

67
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:03,320
They will continue
to do so when you go home.

68
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,824
- Home?
- You'll return to Casterly Rock

69
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:09,126
<i>and rule in my stead.</i>

70
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:11,328
You are the Lord
of Casterly Rock.

71
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:16,000
I am the King's Hand.
My place is here.

72
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:19,570
I don't expect to see
the Rock again before I die.

73
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:22,139
You know
what they call me?

74
00:07:22,174 --> 00:07:24,441
Kingslayer.
Oathbreaker.

75
00:07:24,476 --> 00:07:26,110
Man without honor.

76
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:28,779
Now you want me to break
another sacred vow.

77
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:31,382
You won't be
breaking anything.

78
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,451
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

79
00:07:34,486 --> 00:07:37,555
The king will exercise
that prerogative.

80
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:40,157
- No.
- No?

81
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,992
No.

82
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:45,371
I don't believe
I asked you a question.

83
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:46,202
There's my answer.

84
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:48,227
If you think your bloody
honor comes before--

85
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,334
My bloody honor
is beyond repair,

86
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:53,003
but my answer is still no.
I don't want Casterly Rock.

87
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,305
I don't want a wife.
I don't want children.

88
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,907
What do you want?

89
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,543
Supper would be nice.

90
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,948
For 40 years
I've tried to teach you.

91
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:06,217
If you haven't learned by now,
you never will.

92
00:08:07,285 --> 00:08:08,385
Go.

93
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,387
<i>If serving as a glorified</i>
<i>bodyguard</i>

94
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:13,090
is the sum of your ambition,
go serve.

95
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:15,793
I suppose you want
the sword back.

96
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,995
Keep it.

97
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:19,864
A one-handed man
with no family needs

98
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:21,469
all the help he can get.

99
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,093
( goats bleat )

100
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,762
How many Dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?

101
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:53,831
Please don't.

102
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,967
Bronn: <i>Seems to me</i>
<i>the smart place</i>

103
00:08:57,002 --> 00:08:58,936
<i>to meet travelers</i>
<i>is in a tavern.</i>

104
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,804
That way, one party is late,

105
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,240
the other party can drink
some ale inside.

106
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,975
This is the Prince of Dorne
we're waiting for,

107
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,411
not one of your
sellsword friends.

108
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:10,648
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you to meet him?

109
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:15,719
There's bad blood between
the Martells of Dorne

110
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:18,389
and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
Has been for years.

111
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,658
And just in case
the Martells of Dorne

112
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:22,626
are looking to spill
some Lannister blood,

113
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:25,062
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

114
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,588
I happen to be
an accomplished diplomat.

115
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:27,831
Oh.

116
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,701
Ah, here we are.

117
00:09:30,735 --> 00:09:33,470
( claps )

118
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,639
<i>Can you read the sigils?</i>

119
00:09:37,609 --> 00:09:38,976
Yellow balls?

120
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,711
Wild lemons
on a purple field,

121
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:43,047
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

122
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:47,484
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons,
House Blackmont.

123
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,387
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

124
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,156
Boy knows his
Dornish Houses.

125
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,724
I need a sigil.

126
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:57,328
And House Martell,
a red sun pierced by a spear?

127
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:58,829
I don't see it,
my lord.

128
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,609
Well met, my lords.

129
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:06,000
His Grace King Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.

130
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:09,373
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.

131
00:10:09,407 --> 00:10:11,642
I am Tyrion Lannister
of Casterly Rock,

132
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:14,411
Master of Coin.

133
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:17,768
Forgive me.

134
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,768
I don't see Prince Doran
in your company.

135
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,022
The prince's health
forces him to remain at Sunspear.

136
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:28,192
He sends his brother
Prince Oberyn

137
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:31,061
<i>to attend the royal</i>
<i>wedding in his stead.</i>

138
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, the king will be delighted
to enjoy the company

139
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:38,268
of a warrior
as renowned as Prince Oberyn

140
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,170
at his wedding feast.

141
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,271
Will he?

142
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:44,274
And where is
Prince Oberyn?

143
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:45,709
Arrived before dawn.

144
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:48,345
Not a man
for welcome parties,

145
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,314
<i>our prince.</i>

146
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:54,018
Very well. My lords, these
fine men from the City Watch

147
00:10:54,052 --> 00:10:56,587
will escort you to your
quarters in the Red Keep.

148
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:59,723
You must be weary
after such a long journey.

149
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,764
Some accomplished
diplomacy that was.

150
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,465
Now where?

151
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,813
We must find Prince Oberyn
before he kills somebody

152
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,469
or several somebodies.

153
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,572
How do you plan on finding
a single Dornishman in a city this big?

154
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,741
You're famous for fucking
half of Westeros.

155
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:20,811
You just arrived at the capital after
two weeks of bad roads,

156
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,279
where would you go?

157
00:11:22,313 --> 00:11:25,449
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

158
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,542
Look at this one.

159
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:55,112
How lovely is she?

160
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:57,014
Beautiful.

161
00:11:57,048 --> 00:11:58,782
But pale.

162
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:00,784
They like them pale
in the capital.

163
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:03,387
Shows they don't
work the fields.

164
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,058
Do I frighten you?

165
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:11,261
You like?

166
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:14,498
Timid.
Timid bores me.

167
00:12:20,305 --> 00:12:23,040
You're a bit of mischief,
aren't you?

168
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,211
I think she likes you.

169
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:28,912
She has good taste.

170
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:33,784
You're not timid,
are you?

171
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,923
( laughs )
Not timid.

172
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,792
Do you like women?

173
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:43,760
When they look
like her, my lord.

174
00:12:43,795 --> 00:12:45,996
This one will do nicely.

175
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,065
Olyvar:
<i>Very good, my lady.</i>

176
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:50,334
Oh, I'm not a lady.

177
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:52,636
A term of courtesy
in this establishment.

178
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,538
A lie anywhere.

179
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:56,974
Why not use
the right words?

180
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,609
I'm a bastard.

181
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:02,312
She is a whore.
And you're what?

182
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,481
A procurer.

183
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:06,116
Any of the others?

184
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:09,887
The two girls can leave.

185
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:11,855
- ( snaps fingers )
- You stay.

186
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:15,459
I'm afraid I'm not
an offer, my lord.

187
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:18,529
Everyone who works
for Littlefinger is an offer.

188
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:21,331
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

189
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,501
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

190
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,304
Have you ever been
with a prince?

191
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,507
Can't say I have.

192
00:13:34,045 --> 00:13:36,513
I'm wildly expensive.

193
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:40,117
Take off your clothes.

194
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,259
Which way do you
like it?

195
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:53,297
- ( gasps )
- My way.

196
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:57,734
Man: <i>♪ And so he spoke</i>
<i>and so he spoke ♪</i>

197
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,939
<i>♪ That Lord of Castamere ♪</i>

198
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:04,575
- <i>♪ And now the rains... ♪</i>
- Oberyn.

199
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:07,544
- <i>♪ Weep o'er his hall... ♪</i>
- Oberyn, don't.

200
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:11,281

201
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:16,320

202
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:22,526
♪ And not a soul

203
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,802
You lost, friend?

204
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:34,771
Forgive me for staring.

205
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,474
I don't see many
Lannisters where I'm from.

206
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:40,244
I don't see many
Dornishmen in the capital.

207
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:43,580
We don't like the smell.
( laughs )

208
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:46,350
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

209
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,685
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for a private room.

210
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,988
Why are you wasting a woman
like this on a Dornishman?

211
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:53,123
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

212
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:55,726
( laughs )

213
00:14:58,663 --> 00:15:01,632
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

214
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:10,941
You think your gold
and your lions

215
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:14,478
and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

216
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:18,982
May I tell you a secret?

217
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:21,451
You're not a golden lion.

218
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,021
You're just a pink
little man

219
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,390
who is far too slow
on the draw.

220
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:34,097
( screams )

221
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,702
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

222
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:41,004
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

223
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,674
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

224
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,142
( groans )

225
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,978
He'll live if you
get him help straightaway.

226
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,649
So, decisions.

227
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:56,086
Prince Oberyn,
forgive the intrusion.

228
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,088
- We heard there might be...
- ( screams )

229
00:15:58,122 --> 00:16:00,223
...trouble.

230
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,527
Apologies, my love.

231
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,735
I'm here to welcome you
to the capital.

232
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:19,109
Ellaria Sand,
my paramour.

233
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,079
The king's own Uncle Imp.

234
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:25,015
Tyrion, son
of Tywin Lannister.

235
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,683
If there's anything
I can do to make your stay--

236
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:28,485
What are you?
His hired killer?

237
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,955
It started that way, aye.
Now I'm a knight.

238
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,256
How did that come to pass?

239
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,625
Killed the right people,
I suppose.

240
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:39,863
( laughs )

241
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:43,467
We'll need a few more girls.
Girls, yes?

242
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,868
You don't partake?

243
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:47,604
Oh, I partook.
Now I'm married.

244
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:50,974
Prince Oberyn, if I may,
a word in private?

245
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,714
Seems I visited
the Lannister brothel by mistake.

246
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:00,217
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

247
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:02,412
The king is very grateful
that you traveled all

248
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,887
this way for his wedding.

249
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:06,857
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

250
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:09,893
I am only the second son
after all.

251
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:11,962
Well, speaking
as a fellow second son,

252
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:15,332
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

253
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:16,733
( chuckles )

254
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,869
Why did you come
to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?

255
00:17:18,903 --> 00:17:20,370
I was invited
to the royal wedding.

256
00:17:20,405 --> 00:17:23,006
I thought we were
speaking truth.

257
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,277
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.

258
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,346
Another wedding.

259
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,515
My sister Elia

260
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,018
and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

261
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:40,824
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.

262
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:44,494
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

263
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,531
Elia wouldn't let
the wet nurse touch them.

264
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:51,101
And beautiful, noble
Rhaegar Targaryen

265
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:53,937
left her
for another woman.

266
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:56,139
That started a war

267
00:17:56,174 --> 00:17:58,942
and the war ended
right here

268
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:01,244
when your father's army
took the city...

269
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,646
I wasn't actually present.

270
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,015
...and butchered
those children.

271
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:08,418
My nephew and niece.

272
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:12,589
Carved them up and wrapped them
in Lannister cloaks.

273
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:17,961
And my sister, you know
what they did to her?

274
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:22,532
I'm asking you
a question.

275
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:24,701
I've heard rumors.

276
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,370
( chuckles )
So have I.

277
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:31,341
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain

278
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,311
raped Elia
and split her in half

279
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,679
with his great sword.

280
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:37,614
I wasn't there.
I don't know what happened.

281
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:39,349
If the Mountain
killed my sister,

282
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,618
your father gave the order.

283
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,888
Tell your father
I'm here.

284
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:50,193
And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

285
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,608
<i>( dragons screeching )</i>

00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:14,511
They're dragons,
Khaleesi.

296
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:17,347
They can never be tamed.

297
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:20,083
Not even by their mother.

298
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:43,406
- Ser Barristan.
- Your Grace.

299
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,743
Where's Daario Naharis?

300
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,511
Where's Grey Worm?

301
00:20:49,814 --> 00:20:52,415
Gambling, Your Grace.

302
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,485
Gambling?

303
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:20,977
Crowd: Mhysa. Mhysa.
Mhysa...

304
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,554
How long have they
been at it?

305
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:33,857
Since midnight,
Your Grace.

306
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:36,526
Ser Worm is stronger
than he looks.

307
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,428
But I can see his arms
beginning to shake.

308
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,830
What's the prize to winning
this stupid contest?

309
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,999
The honor of riding by your side
on the road to Meereen.

310
00:21:43,034 --> 00:21:46,603
That honor goes to
Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan

311
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:48,972
as neither of them kept
me waiting this morning.

312
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:52,542
You two will ride in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.

313
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,312
The last man
holding his sword

314
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:58,882
can find a new queen
to fight for.

315
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,251
<i>( Daario groans )</i>

00:22:27,445 --> 00:22:29,879
You need
to eat something.

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,051
Pigeon pie.

319
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:37,320
No, thank you.

320
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,293
Lemon cakes?

321
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:45,028
No, thank you.

322
00:22:45,062 --> 00:22:46,930
You love lemon cakes.

323
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:49,733
Tell her
she needs to eat.

324
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:51,501
My lady, you do
need to eat.

325
00:22:51,535 --> 00:22:53,470
I don't need to eat.

326
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,575
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

327
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:09,986
She needs to eat.

328
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:19,195
I can't let you starve.

329
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,164
<i>I swore to protect you.</i>

330
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,039
My lady,

331
00:23:30,074 --> 00:23:32,375
I am your husband.
Let me help you.

332
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,312
How can you
help me?

333
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:38,982
I don't know,
but I can try.

334
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:44,988
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy

335
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:47,857
thinking about
how they died.

336
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:51,227
I could get you essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.

337
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:53,429
Do you know what
they did to my brother?

338
00:23:55,633 --> 00:23:58,802
How they sewed his direwolf's
head onto his body?

339
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:02,272
And my mother.

340
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,874
They say they cut
her throat to the bone

341
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,011
and threw her body
in the river.

342
00:24:08,045 --> 00:24:12,048
<i>What happened to your family</i>
<i>was a terrible crime.</i>

343
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:13,347
I didn't know your brother.

344
00:24:13,372 --> 00:24:15,373
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.

345
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:18,388
<i>Your mother,</i>
<i>on the other hand,</i>

346
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:20,423
<i>I admired her.</i>

347
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:22,659
She wanted to have
me executed,

348
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,694
but I admired her.

349
00:24:26,263 --> 00:24:28,464
She was a strong woman.

350
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:30,600
And she was fierce

351
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:32,802
when it came
to protecting her children.

352
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,307
Sansa.

353
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,878
Your mother would want
you to carry on.

354
00:24:41,912 --> 00:24:43,246
You know it's true.

355
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,986
Will you pardon me,
my lord?

356
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,588
I'd like to visit
the godswood.

357
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:54,724
Of course. Of course.
Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

358
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:57,460
I don't pray anymore.

359
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:01,064
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

360
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,517
My lion.

361
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:24,053
What are you doing?

362
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,460
What does it look like
I'm doing? Come here.

363
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:33,162
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

364
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,831
I know.
I know.

365
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,133
We have come
to a dangerous place.

366
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,636
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it's been?

367
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,970
Of course
I haven't forgotten.

368
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:43,306
I want you.

369
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,807
Don't you want me?

370
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,878
Things are a bit tense
right now.

371
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:51,047
What things?

372
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:53,149
My nephew the king
wants to murder me.

373
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:55,818
My wife hates me because my father
murdered her family.

374
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,698
Oberyn Martell wants
to murder everyone whose

375
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,322
last name is Lannister.

376
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:03,826
You need to relax.

377
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,604
Don't you want
to relax?

378
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:22,011
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

379
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:24,514
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

380
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:27,617
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

381
00:26:28,686 --> 00:26:30,219
- Do you love her?
- Love her?

382
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:32,422
I barely know her.
She's a child.

383
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:35,091
- She despises me.
- That's not an answer.

384
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:37,327
Of course
I don't love her.

385
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,395
You tried
to ship me away.

386
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,531
Ship you away?

387
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,368
Give me diamonds
and make me disappear.

388
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:47,236
What in the world
are you talking about?

389
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,172
If you want me to leave,
just say it.

390
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,976
- Say it!
- Shh.

391
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,078
I don't know what
you're talking about.

392
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,747
You want me to stay?

393
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:25,908
( groans )

394
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:28,378
A work of art, really.

395
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:30,246
The craftsmanship
is excellent.

396
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,674
You like it so much,

397
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:33,661
you're welcome to chop off
your own hand and take it.

398
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:35,651
Such an ingrate.
I spent days with the goldsmith

399
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:38,287
- getting the details just right.
- Days?

400
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:41,223
Better part
of an afternoon.

401
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:43,893
There, how does
that feel?

402
00:27:43,927 --> 00:27:45,761
Uh...

403
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:48,030
a hook would be
more practical.

404
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:49,932
Elegant, I think.

405
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,640
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

406
00:27:57,707 --> 00:27:59,875
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

407
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,410
I am in your debt,
Maester Qyburn.

408
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,779
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help

409
00:28:03,813 --> 00:28:05,681
whenever I can.

410
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:16,292
Odd little man.

411
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:18,294
- I've grown rather fond of him.
- <i>( door closes )</i>

412
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:20,229
He's quite talented,
you know?

413
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:21,897
What symptoms?

414
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,266
Symptoms that are
not your concern.

415
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,535
You let him
touch you?

416
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,737
You jealous?

417
00:28:28,772 --> 00:28:30,472
I'm surprised.

418
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:31,907
You never let
Pycelle near you.

419
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:34,076
( laughs ) You think I'd let
that old lecher

420
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,345
put his hands on me?

421
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:38,948
He smells like a dead cat.

422
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:41,350
<i>I'm not sure I've ever</i>
<i>smelled a dead cat.</i>

423
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,586
Well, they smell
like Pycelle.

424
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,322
You drink more
than you used to.

425
00:28:46,356 --> 00:28:48,390
- Yes.
- Why?

426
00:28:48,425 --> 00:28:52,661
Let's see, you started
a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark

427
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:54,797
and disappeared
from the capital.

428
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:57,366
My husband died in a tragic
hunting accident.

429
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,101
It must have been
traumatic for you.

430
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:00,536
My only daughter
was shipped off to Dorne.

431
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,204
<i>We suffered</i>
<i>through a siege.</i>

432
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:03,872
A rather short siege.

433
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:06,241
A rather short siege
that I didn't expect to survive.

434
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:08,210
And now I'm marrying
my eldest son

435
00:29:08,244 --> 00:29:10,379
to a wicked little
bitch from Highgarden

436
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:12,514
while I'm supposed
to marry her brother,

437
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,150
a renowned pillow biter.
So...

438
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,753
Father disowned me today.

439
00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:20,155
He can't disown you.
You're all he's got.

440
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,658
You're forgetting Tyrion.

441
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:26,428
You don't really plan on staying in
the Kingsguard, do you?

442
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:33,936
Staying in the Kingsguard
means I live right here

443
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,305
in the Red Keep
with you.

444
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,608
- Not now.
- I want--

445
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:42,845
Not now? When?
I've been back for weeks.

446
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,551
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

447
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:52,554
You come back after all this time
with no apologies

448
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:55,090
and one hand and expect
everything to be the same?

449
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,425
What do you want me
to apologize for?

450
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,893
For leaving me.

451
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,428
You think I wanted
to be taken prisoner?

452
00:29:59,462 --> 00:30:01,363
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

453
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,932
You left me alone.

454
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:07,569
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

455
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:10,906
Every day. I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

456
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,509
- You took too long.
- I...

457
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:17,579
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you took too long.

458
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:18,714
<i>( knocking )</i>

459
00:30:18,748 --> 00:30:20,916
- Come in.
- Jaime: <i>Go away.</i>

460
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,152
Forgive me, Your Grace.

461
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:26,755
You told me to come
at once if there was anything important.

462
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:49,144
You plan on killing
all the crows yourself?

463
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:53,882
Do you plan on sitting
here scratching your balls till winter?

464
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:55,918
We wait for Mance's orders.

465
00:30:55,952 --> 00:30:57,953
You sent a man over the Wall
at the full moon.

466
00:30:57,987 --> 00:30:59,922
<i>If he's not back yet,</i>
<i>he's not coming back.</i>

467
00:30:59,956 --> 00:31:01,457
<i>And what is it</i>
<i>you want?</i>

468
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:03,959
March on Castle Black
with just this lot?

469
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:06,995
Your pretty crow
said 1,000 men are nesting there.

470
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,764
Yeah, well,
he's a liar.

471
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:10,499
He is?

472
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,868
Shouldn't it be
"he was"?

473
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,671
You said you put
three arrows in him.

474
00:31:15,705 --> 00:31:17,339
I did.

475
00:31:17,373 --> 00:31:20,943
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

476
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:25,347
If that boy's still walking,
it's 'cause you let him go.

477
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:28,350
( whistles )

478
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:52,307
Thenns.

479
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:54,843
I fucking hate Thenns.

480
00:32:05,355 --> 00:32:06,922
Mance sent you?

481
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,391
- ( grunts )
- How did you find us?

482
00:32:13,863 --> 00:32:16,832
You came from the south,
not the north.

483
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:19,201
Took a detour.

484
00:32:19,235 --> 00:32:22,671
Got some supper from
a village down that way.

485
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,743
<i>Why does the meat down here</i>
<i>taste so much better</i>

486
00:32:27,777 --> 00:32:29,945
than it does
on our side of the Wall?

487
00:32:29,979 --> 00:32:31,647
Help yourself.

488
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:33,615
( chuckles )

489
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,319
Maybe everything's
just better fed down here.

490
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:40,689
Fat and lazy.

491
00:32:40,723 --> 00:32:43,992
Easier for us, hmm?

492
00:32:45,862 --> 00:32:48,463
You didn't see
us coming?

493
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:50,265
Lost your warg?

494
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:55,204
And that baby crow
you had with you,

495
00:32:55,238 --> 00:32:57,606
lost him too?

496
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:01,743
I'll answer to Mance.

497
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:03,779
I won't answer to you.

498
00:33:03,813 --> 00:33:06,448
She yours?

499
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:10,586
I'm not anybody's.

500
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:21,730
Too scrawny.

501
00:33:21,764 --> 00:33:25,400
Not like those crows
at Castle Black.

502
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:29,171
<i>Think of them</i>
<i>stuck in their larders</i>

503
00:33:29,205 --> 00:33:32,341
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

504
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:35,911
and stew, getting
nice and fat

505
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:37,613
and marbled.

506
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:41,550
I know we've had
our differences, Tormund,

507
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:45,921
but just one time
before you die,

508
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:50,125
you really ought
to try crow.

509
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:54,696
Officer:
<i>Draw.</i>

510
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:56,632
Loose.

511
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:04,706
Jon:
<i>Last time I saw him,</i>

512
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:07,009
<i>he was in the courtyard</i>
<i>at Winterfell.</i>

513
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:11,446
<i>He said,</i>
<i>"Next time I see you,</i>

514
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:14,349
<i>you'll be all in black."</i>

515
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:19,121
I was jealous of Robb
my whole life.

516
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:20,322
( winces )

517
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,624
<i>The way my father</i>
<i>looked at him,</i>

518
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,626
<i>I wanted that.</i>

519
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:27,796
He was better than me
at everything--

520
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,367
fighting and hunting

521
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:35,003
and riding

522
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:36,838
and girls.

523
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:39,908
<i>Gods, the girls</i>
<i>loved him.</i>

524
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,212
I wanted to hate him,
but I never could.

525
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:49,384
Sometimes I want
to hate you.

526
00:34:51,854 --> 00:34:55,190
Well, you're better
than me at everything.

527
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,794
Except reading.

528
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,100
They're--
they're ready for you.

529
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,974
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

530
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:13,308
No one's going
to hang you.

531
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:14,810
You've done
nothing wrong.

532
00:35:14,844 --> 00:35:17,713
I've done plenty wrong.

533
00:35:19,048 --> 00:35:22,284
So you admit you
murdered Qhorin Halfhand?

534
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:24,052
Jon:
<i>I didn't murder him.</i>

535
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:26,555
No?
You put your sword

536
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:28,523
through a brother
of the Night's Watch.

537
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:30,592
What do you call that?

538
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:32,728
He wanted me
to kill him.

539
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:34,563
A bastard son
of a traitor.

540
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:35,998
What would
you expect?

541
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:37,933
The Halfhand believed
our only chance

542
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,235
to stop Mance was to get
a man inside his army.

543
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:42,300
Don't talk about the Halfhand
as if you knew him.

544
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:43,524
He was my brother.

545
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:46,375
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

546
00:35:46,409 --> 00:35:49,211
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

547
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:51,380
Slynt: <i>The free folk?</i>
<i>Listen to him.</i>

548
00:35:51,414 --> 00:35:53,949
He even talks like
a wildling now.

549
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:56,718
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

550
00:35:56,753 --> 00:35:59,354
I climbed the Wall
with the wildlings. I--

551
00:36:01,024 --> 00:36:02,824
I laid with
a wildling girl.

552
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,529
You admit to breaking
your vows, then?

553
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:09,831
I do.

554
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:13,802
The law is the law.
The boy must die.

555
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:17,973
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

556
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:21,743
the Wall would be manned
by headless men.

557
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:23,912
There's a difference
between sneaking off

558
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:27,749
to the Mole's Town brothel
and sleeping with the enemy.

559
00:36:28,651 --> 00:36:30,218
While we sit here

560
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:32,687
debating which rules
I broke,

561
00:36:32,722 --> 00:36:36,258
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

562
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,692
Impossible.

563
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:39,895
You can't get
50 wildlings together

564
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:41,430
before they start
killing each other.

565
00:36:41,464 --> 00:36:44,833
100,000.
He's united the Thenns,

566
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:46,468
<i>the Hornfoots,</i>
<i>the ice-river clans.</i>

567
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:47,969
He has giants
fighting for him.

568
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:50,072
( laughs )
Giants?

569
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:53,508
Have you ever been
beyond the Wall, ser?

570
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:55,677
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

571
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:56,607
And now you're here.

572
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,547
You must not have been
very good at your job.

573
00:36:58,548 --> 00:36:59,748
How dare you?!

574
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:02,884
There's a band of wildlings
south of the Wall already

575
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,953
led by Tormund Giantsbane.

576
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:06,688
I killed their warg
and three others.

577
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:09,024
They shot me
full of arrows.

578
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:12,661
Their orders are to attack
Castle Black from the south

579
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:14,996
when Mance hits
it from the north.

580
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:17,532
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

581
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:19,901
Mance said it would be
the greatest fire

582
00:37:19,936 --> 00:37:21,336
the North has ever seen.

583
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,005
<i>That's the truth.</i>

584
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,774
All the truth.

585
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:33,615
Do you intend to execute me
or am I free to go?

586
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:35,951
None of us are free.

587
00:37:35,985 --> 00:37:37,819
We are men
of the Night's Watch.

588
00:37:37,854 --> 00:37:42,157
But we won't be taking
your head today, Jon Snow.

589
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:43,725
Go on.

590
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,938
I am acting commander here,
Maester Aemon.

591
00:37:56,973 --> 00:37:58,840
Yes, you are.

592
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:00,742
And I don't trust
the bastard.

593
00:38:00,776 --> 00:38:03,812
He told the truth.

594
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:06,014
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

595
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:08,383
How did you acquire
this magical power?

596
00:38:10,219 --> 00:38:12,954
I grew up
in King's Landing.

597
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,326
Olenna:
<i>No. No.</i>

598
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:21,062
You're a queen,
not an ox.

599
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:24,399
Your grandfather
gave me a necklace

600
00:38:24,433 --> 00:38:27,802
just like this one
for my 51st nameday.

601
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:31,439
The wedding is in
a fortnight, Grandmother.

602
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,508
You can't say no
to everything.

603
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:36,178
Nonsense.
My little dears.

604
00:38:36,212 --> 00:38:39,181
Go and speak to the jewelers
of King's Landing.

605
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:41,783
Tell them who you are,
tell them who sent you.

606
00:38:41,817 --> 00:38:43,985
The one who brings
me the best necklace

607
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,655
will get to keep
the next best.

608
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:48,957
( girls laughing )

609
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:53,695
The Margaery Tyrell
who walks into the sept

610
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:57,232
a fortnight from now
will inspire 1,000 songs.

611
00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:00,702
Now, how sad it will be if
she's wearing rubbish like that.

612
00:39:00,736 --> 00:39:04,172
Perhaps I should just let
Joffrey choose it for me.

613
00:39:04,207 --> 00:39:06,474
End up with a string 
of dead sparrow heads around my neck.

614
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:10,078
You watch that.
Even here, even with me.

615
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:11,546
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

616
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:14,149
My word.

617
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:16,851
My lady.
My lady.

618
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:19,854
Please pardon me
for interrupting.

619
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:21,690
My name is Brienne
of Tarth.

620
00:39:21,724 --> 00:39:23,358
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

621
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,927
But hearing is one thing.

622
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:28,630
Aren't you just marvelous?

623
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:31,967
Absolutely singular.

624
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,569
I hear you knocked
my grandson into the dirt

625
00:39:34,604 --> 00:39:37,806
like the silly little
boy he is.

626
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,242
My lady, I know this is
a very busy time for you,

627
00:39:40,276 --> 00:39:42,978
but if I could
just have a moment.

628
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:46,014
You dare not refuse.

629
00:39:48,651 --> 00:39:50,118
A shadow?

630
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:52,754
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

631
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:58,059
I swear to you by all
the gods it was Stannis.

632
00:39:58,094 --> 00:40:00,829
He plunged his sword
through Renly's heart

633
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:03,365
and disappeared.

634
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:06,301
One day, my lady,
I will avenge our king.

635
00:40:06,335 --> 00:40:08,637
Joffrey is our king now.

636
00:40:08,671 --> 00:40:10,839
I meant no offense.

637
00:40:10,873 --> 00:40:12,741
And you've given none.

638
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,252
All the Kingsguard
will be on duty, of course.

639
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:26,087
Ser Boros
will be stationed here.

640
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:28,089
Ser Preston
will be stationed here

641
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:31,693
beside the primary
entertainment.

642
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:35,096
Your Grace?

643
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:37,699
Yes, yes,
one guard at the--

644
00:40:37,767 --> 00:40:39,534
the thing.
Go on.

645
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:42,771
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

646
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:45,440
I've always guarded
the king himself, my lord.

647
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:47,676
Ever since your absence.

648
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,778
And I thank you
for it, Ser Meryn.

649
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:52,514
All very good.
I don't expect any trouble.

650
00:40:52,548 --> 00:40:54,316
The people love
their king.

651
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,850
They know who
keeps them fed.

652
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:57,886
Margaery Tyrell,
I've heard.

653
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:00,889
By my leave.

654
00:41:00,923 --> 00:41:04,092
They know I saved the city.
They know I won the war.

655
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:06,094
The war's not won.
Not while Stannis lives.

656
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:08,496
I broke Stannis
on the Blackwater.

657
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:10,932
Pity you weren't
there to help, Uncle.

658
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:13,702
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

659
00:41:13,736 --> 00:41:15,937
Busy getting captured.

660
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:19,974
So this is the famous
"Book of Brothers"?

661
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:22,977
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.

662
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:29,084
Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Sword of the Morning.

663
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:30,952
( chuckles )

664
00:41:30,986 --> 00:41:34,122
Led the attack
on the Kingswood Brotherhood.

665
00:41:34,156 --> 00:41:36,491
Defeated the Smiling Knight
in single combat.

666
00:41:36,525 --> 00:41:39,260
Ser Duncan the Tall.

667
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:41,196
( laughs )

668
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,698
Four pages
for Ser Duncan.

669
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:45,300
He must have been
quite a man.

670
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:47,168
So they say.

671
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,673
Ser Jaime Lannister.

672
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:53,908
( chuckles )

673
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,747
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

674
00:41:58,781 --> 00:42:01,716
- There's still time.
- Is there?

675
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:04,919
For a 40-year-old knight
with one hand?

676
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:08,123
How can you protect me
with that?

677
00:42:08,157 --> 00:42:09,724
I use my left hand
now, Your Grace.

678
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:11,993
Makes for more
of a contest.

679
00:42:29,578 --> 00:42:31,679
Daenerys: Have you ever been
to Meereen?

680
00:42:31,714 --> 00:42:34,149
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

681
00:42:34,183 --> 00:42:35,583
And?

682
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:37,786
They say
1,000 slaves died

683
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,621
building the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

684
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:41,890
And now an army
of former slaves

685
00:42:41,924 --> 00:42:44,292
is marching
to her gates.

686
00:42:44,326 --> 00:42:46,528
You think the Great
Masters are worried?

687
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:49,531
If they're smart,
Your Grace.

688
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:55,537
You were told to ride
at the back of the train.

689
00:42:55,571 --> 00:42:57,305
Yes, my queen.

690
00:42:57,339 --> 00:43:00,108
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

691
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:03,077
A matter of strategy.

692
00:43:07,116 --> 00:43:08,616
Your Grace.

693
00:43:12,354 --> 00:43:14,823
All right, what is this
matter of strategy?

694
00:43:17,693 --> 00:43:19,794
A dusk rose.

695
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,230
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?

696
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:25,266
And this one's called
lady's lace.

697
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:27,368
Would you like
to walk without shoes?

698
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:29,637
You have to know
a land to rule it.

699
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,773
Its plants,
its rivers,

700
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,509
its roads,
its people.

701
00:43:34,543 --> 00:43:36,911
Dusk rose tea
eases fever.

702
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:38,680
Everyone in Meereen
knows that.

703
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:41,015
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

704
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,550
If you want them
to follow you,

705
00:43:42,585 --> 00:43:44,219
you have to become
a part of their world.

706
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:45,620
Strategy.

707
00:43:48,557 --> 00:43:50,458
Harpy's Gold.

708
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:52,093
No tea from this one.

709
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:54,395
Beautiful but poisonous.

710
00:44:00,936 --> 00:44:02,937
You are a gambler,
aren't you?

711
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,614
Your Grace.

712
00:44:20,356 --> 00:44:22,290
<i>( man shouts in Valyrian )</i>

713
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:47,482
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

714
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:50,818
How many miles are there between
here and Meereen?

715
00:44:50,853 --> 00:44:54,255
163, Your Grace.

716
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:56,424
Barristan: <i>I'll tell our men to ride</i>
<i>ahead and bury them.</i>

717
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,959
You don't need
to see this.

718
00:44:57,993 --> 00:45:01,062
You will do
no such thing.

719
00:45:01,096 --> 00:45:04,799
I will see each
and every one of their faces.

720
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:09,070
Remove her collar
before you bury her.

721
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:17,745
Brienne:
<i>There she is.</i>

722
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,114
Jaime:
Yes, there she is.

723
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:24,385
- And?
- You made a promise.

724
00:45:24,453 --> 00:45:27,622
To return the Stark girls
to their mother who is now dead.

725
00:45:27,656 --> 00:45:29,223
To keep them safe.

726
00:45:29,258 --> 00:45:31,225
Well, Arya Stark
hasn't been seen

727
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,927
since her father
was killed.

728
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:35,597
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

729
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:37,732
There's a certain safety
in death, wouldn't you say?

730
00:45:37,766 --> 00:45:41,035
And Sansa Stark is now
Sansa Lannister.

731
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,870
Bit of a complication.

732
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,440
A complication does not
release you from a vow.

733
00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:47,675
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sister-in-law?

734
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:50,411
And take her where?
Where would she be safer than here?

735
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:52,246
Look me in the eye
and tell me

736
00:45:52,281 --> 00:45:54,582
that you think she'll be
safe in King's Landing.

737
00:46:00,456 --> 00:46:03,691
Are you sure
we're not related?

738
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:05,994
Ever since I've returned,
every Lannister I've seen

739
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:07,629
has been a miserable
pain in my ass.

740
00:46:07,663 --> 00:46:09,163
Maybe you're
a Lannister, too.

741
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:12,033
You've got the hair for it
if not the looks.

742
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:32,220
<i>( footsteps )</i>

743
00:46:35,658 --> 00:46:38,893
<i>( footsteps stop )</i>

744
00:46:38,927 --> 00:46:40,395
( gasps )

745
00:47:03,185 --> 00:47:05,553
- ( gasps )
- It's all right.

746
00:47:05,587 --> 00:47:07,689
It's all right.
It's all right.

747
00:47:09,491 --> 00:47:11,926
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

748
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,429
I have good reason to be.

749
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:18,266
Once I was a knight.
Now I'm only a fool.

750
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:22,203
Don't you know me?

751
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:27,709
Ser Dontos.
The king's nameday celebration.

752
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,011
I'm sorry.
I should have remembered.

753
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:32,080
I can't accept your apology.

754
00:47:32,114 --> 00:47:35,583
I may be a fool,
but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

755
00:47:35,617 --> 00:47:37,985
Anyone would have
done the same.

756
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,954
But only you did.

757
00:47:39,988 --> 00:47:42,490
I can never repay you.

758
00:47:42,524 --> 00:47:45,860
You gave me my life.
But this,

759
00:47:45,894 --> 00:47:49,130
this is worth
more than my life.

760
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:54,502
It belonged to my mother
and her mother before her.

761
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:56,404
House Hollard
was strong once.

762
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,439
House on the rise.

763
00:47:58,474 --> 00:48:01,008
That's all that's left
of those days,

764
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:04,879
thanks to a few sad,
fat drunks like me.

765
00:48:04,913 --> 00:48:06,848
I can't take it.

766
00:48:06,882 --> 00:48:09,951
It's very, very kind of you,
but I can't.

767
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:12,153
I don't have
anything else left.

768
00:48:12,187 --> 00:48:14,689
That's all.

769
00:48:14,723 --> 00:48:16,424
Take it.
Wear it.

770
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:19,026
Let my name have
one more moment in the sun

771
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:21,295
before it disappears
from the world.

772
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:28,169
I'll wear it with pride,
Ser Dontos.

773
00:48:28,203 --> 00:48:30,471
Yeah.

774
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,355
<i>( flies buzzing )</i>

775
00:48:56,832 --> 00:48:58,432
Arya: <i>When am I going to get</i>
<i>a horse of my own?</i>

776
00:48:58,467 --> 00:49:00,768
The little lady
wants a pony.

777
00:49:00,803 --> 00:49:03,604
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

778
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:06,541
Horses aren't easy
to come by.

779
00:49:06,575 --> 00:49:07,580
Even if they were,

780
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:09,503
you think I'm gonna put
you on your own horse?

781
00:49:10,345 --> 00:49:13,815
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

782
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:16,684
Why don't you
have any money?

783
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:19,253
Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey
before you left?

784
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:21,255
No.

785
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,324
You're not very smart,
are you?

786
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:25,293
I'm not a thief.

787
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:27,328
You're fine with
murdering little boys,

788
00:49:27,362 --> 00:49:29,230
but thieving
is beneath you?

789
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:31,933
A man's got
to have a code.

790
00:49:31,967 --> 00:49:34,402
You think
I'm gonna escape?

791
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,437
Where would I go?

792
00:49:36,471 --> 00:49:38,406
I'd be dead by nightfall
without you.

793
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,908
My family's gone.
I've got no one.

794
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:44,212
You've got an aunt
in the Vale.

795
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:47,448
Your rich Aunt Lysa.
After I sell you to her,

796
00:49:47,482 --> 00:49:49,483
maybe she'll have
enough left over

797
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:51,652
to buy you that pony
you want so much.

798
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,059
Arya: <i>I'm hungry.</i>
<i>You're hungry.</i>

799
00:49:58,093 --> 00:50:00,628
Five horses,
five men.

800
00:50:00,662 --> 00:50:04,198
More than I feel like
killing on an empty stomach.

801
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:12,807
I know him.

802
00:50:12,841 --> 00:50:15,576
<i>The small one.</i>
<i>His name is Polliver.</i>

803
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:18,713
He captured us
and took us to Harrenhal.

804
00:50:18,747 --> 00:50:20,982
( urinating )

805
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:22,917
He killed Lommy.

806
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:24,719
What the fuck's a Lommy?

807
00:50:24,753 --> 00:50:27,288
He was my friend.

808
00:50:27,322 --> 00:50:30,291
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through his neck.

809
00:50:32,694 --> 00:50:33,794
He's still got it.

810
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:35,563
Hound:
<i>Got what?</i>

811
00:50:35,597 --> 00:50:37,465
My sword Needle.

812
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:41,335
Needle?
Of course you named your sword.

813
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:42,670
Lots of people
name their swords.

814
00:50:42,704 --> 00:50:44,839
Lots of cunts.

815
00:50:50,212 --> 00:50:52,847
What are you--
get back here.

816
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:54,482
My brother gave me
that sword.

817
00:50:54,516 --> 00:50:57,218
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

818
00:50:57,252 --> 00:50:58,986
I don't care
if he ate your friend.

819
00:50:59,021 --> 00:51:00,955
We're not going in there.

820
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,261
- <i>( man laughing )</i>
- Man: <i>Come on, give it up.</i>

821
00:51:07,296 --> 00:51:09,430
<i>( woman whimpering )</i>

822
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:13,567
- Come here.
- ( whimpering )

823
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:16,671
- Let's have a feel there.
- Leave it.

824
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:47,802
- ( laughing )
- Come here.

825
00:51:49,805 --> 00:51:51,639
Please,
she's a good girl.

826
00:51:51,673 --> 00:51:53,274
Shut your mouth
and pour us more ale

827
00:51:53,308 --> 00:51:55,743
and we may not take
her with us when we're done with her.

828
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:02,650
I know you.

829
00:52:05,354 --> 00:52:07,054
You're the Hound.

830
00:52:09,324 --> 00:52:11,092
<i>Pour our new friend</i>
<i>some ale.</i>

831
00:52:14,129 --> 00:52:17,832
What brings you
so far north?

832
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:19,433
I could ask
the same of you.

833
00:52:19,468 --> 00:52:20,508
What are you
doing up here?

834
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:22,136
Just keeping
the king's peace.

835
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,904
No need.
The war's over.

836
00:52:23,939 --> 00:52:27,308
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.

837
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:29,343
Robb Stark killed
at the Twins.

838
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:30,611
And where am I
for all of it?

839
00:52:30,645 --> 00:52:32,713
Stuck with your brother.

840
00:52:32,748 --> 00:52:35,316
- Meaning no offense.
- None taken.

841
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,018
He's good,
the Mountain is.

842
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:38,519
Best at what he does.

843
00:52:38,553 --> 00:52:41,822
But torture, torture,
torture, torture.

844
00:52:41,857 --> 00:52:44,592
<i>You spend enough time putting</i>
<i>the hammer to people,</i>

845
00:52:44,626 --> 00:52:47,661
<i>you start to feel like</i>
<i>a carpenter making chairs.</i>

846
00:52:47,696 --> 00:52:49,764
Drains the fun
right out of it.

847
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:51,065
And what's life
without a little fun?

848
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:53,200
<i>( chuckles )</i>

849
00:52:54,636 --> 00:52:56,737
But I don't need
to tell you that, eh?

850
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,342
She's all right.
I've had better.

851
00:53:01,376 --> 00:53:02,710
( laughs )

852
00:53:04,346 --> 00:53:06,947
You know what?

853
00:53:06,982 --> 00:53:08,816
You should come
with us.

854
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:12,720
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.

855
00:53:12,754 --> 00:53:15,689
Gold, silver,
more daughters.

856
00:53:15,724 --> 00:53:18,192
<i>Always something if you</i>
<i>know how to make them talk.</i>

857
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:20,728
And there's plenty of him
between here and King's Landing.

858
00:53:20,762 --> 00:53:22,463
You could do well
for yourself.

859
00:53:22,497 --> 00:53:24,298
We certainly have been.

860
00:53:27,602 --> 00:53:29,870
I'm not going
to King's Landing.

861
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:32,573
Think about it.
We could do whatever we like

862
00:53:32,607 --> 00:53:35,409
wherever we go.

863
00:53:35,444 --> 00:53:37,378
These are
the king's colors.

864
00:53:37,412 --> 00:53:39,380
No one's standing
in his way now.

865
00:53:39,414 --> 00:53:42,583
Which means no one's
standing in ours.

866
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:45,853
Fuck the king.

867
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:48,022
( chatter stops )

868
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,165
When I heard that Joffrey's
dog had tucked tail

869
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,301
and run from the Battle
of the Blackwater,

870
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:02,403
I didn't believe it.

871
00:54:02,437 --> 00:54:05,139
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

872
00:54:05,173 --> 00:54:07,775
Bring me one
of those chickens.

873
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:09,944
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

874
00:54:09,978 --> 00:54:12,379
( laughs )
No.

875
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:14,181
But we're
the king's men.

876
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,751
So, you got money?

877
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:19,587
Not a penny.

878
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:22,490
I'll still
take that chicken.

879
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:24,225
Tell you what.

880
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:26,293
We'll trade you.

881
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:28,496
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

882
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,499
<i>Give us a go</i>
<i>at your friend.</i>

883
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:34,902
Lowell there likes them
a bit broken in.

884
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,204
<i>( men chuckle )</i>

885
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,645
You're a talker.

886
00:54:45,914 --> 00:54:49,283
Listening to talkers
makes me thirsty.

887
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,901
Ah.

888
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:08,903
And hungry.

889
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,672
Think I'll take
two chickens.

890
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:22,850
You don't seem to
understand the situation.

891
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:25,519
I understand that
if any more words

892
00:55:25,554 --> 00:55:28,189
come pouring out
of your cunt mouth,

893
00:55:28,223 --> 00:55:31,926
I'm gonna have to eat
every fucking chicken in this room.

894
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,695
You lived your life
for the king.

895
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:38,365
You're gonna die
for some chickens?

896
00:55:39,701 --> 00:55:41,602
Someone is.

897
00:55:50,312 --> 00:55:52,313
( shouts )

898
00:56:04,459 --> 00:56:06,694

908
00:57:38,853 --> 00:57:41,855
Something wrong
with your leg, boy?

909
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,857
What?
What do you mean?

910
00:57:43,892 --> 00:57:46,860
Can you walk?
I've got to carry you?

911
00:57:46,895 --> 00:57:48,696
Carry me?

912
00:57:50,899 --> 00:57:52,800
Fine little blade.

913
00:57:58,006 --> 00:58:00,607
Maybe I'll pick
my teeth with it.

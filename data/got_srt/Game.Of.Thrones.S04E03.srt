4
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:00,566
You did this.
You did this!

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,869
- We have to leave.
- Cersei: <i>Take him! Take him!</i>

6
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:08,607
Where is his wife?

7
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,176
Where's Sansa?

8
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,545
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

9
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:16,048
<i>Seize every ship</i>
<i>in the harbor.</i>

10
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,584
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

11
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,653
<i>No one!</i>

12
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,856
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

13
00:02:48,748 --> 00:02:51,183
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

14
00:02:51,218 --> 00:02:52,985
Somewhere safe.

15
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,165
Up you go, my lady.

16
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,436
You'll be fine.

17
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,338
You're stronger
than you know.

18
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,155
( gasps )

19
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,059
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

20
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:09,161
Are you hurt,
my lady?

21
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,930
Good. Good.

22
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:13,799
I'm sure you've had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

23
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,768
- The worst is past.
- Dontos: <i>Lord Baelish.</i>

24
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,076
<i>I promised I'd get</i>
<i>her to you safely.</i>

25
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,404
Softly, my friend.

26
00:04:18,405 --> 00:04:21,040
Voices carry
over water.

27
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,109
I should get back before
someone thinks to look for me.

28
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,145
First you'll want
your pay.

29
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,981
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

30
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:33,152
( snaps fingers )

31
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,922
Wait!
( groans )

32
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,290
( screams )

33
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:40,326
Littlefinger:
<i>Shh.</i>

34
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,227
You don't want
the queen to hear, do you?

35
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:44,897
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

36
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,799
And if they found you,

37
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:50,502
how do you think they would punish
the girl who murdered the king?

38
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:53,872
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

39
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:55,140
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

40
00:04:55,175 --> 00:04:57,242
The king who
executed your father,

41
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,511
who tormented you
for years,

42
00:04:59,546 --> 00:05:02,281
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

43
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,483
Why did you kill him?

44
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:07,252
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

45
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,122
and I don't trust
drunk fools.

46
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,391
He saved me.

47
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:15,394
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

48
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:19,798
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

49
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,501
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

50
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,871
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

51
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:31,043
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

52
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:35,180
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

53
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:38,283
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

54
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:41,387
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

55
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:52,197
I had it made
a few weeks ago.

56
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:56,435
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

57
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,138
We're all liars here.

58
00:06:00,974 --> 00:06:02,875
Come, my lady.

59
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,544
I know you've had
a difficult day.

60
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:07,680
But you're safe now.

61
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:09,848
I promise you that.

62
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,051
You're safe with me

63
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,687
and sailing home.

64
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:23,429
So am I the queen?

65
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,230
More than you were
with Renly.

66
00:06:25,265 --> 00:06:28,333
Less than you would have been if
Joffrey had done you the courtesy

67
00:06:28,368 --> 00:06:31,303
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

68
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,573
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

69
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,475
to press the issue.

70
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,343
Clawing at his own throat,

71
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:41,246
looking to his mother to make it stop--
it was horrible.

72
00:06:41,281 --> 00:06:43,782
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

73
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:46,085
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

74
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,823
They brought me your grandfather's
body when he died, you know?

75
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:52,658
Made me look at it.

76
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,226
What was it like?

77
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,429
They took me to the Great
Hall and there he was.

78
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,298
The man I'd married

79
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:02,568
and suffered to father
my children.

80
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,837
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

81
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:08,273
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

82
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:10,876
There he was...

83
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,313
lying on a table.

84
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,718
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

85
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,420
and was stabbed
through the heart.

86
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:23,822
Another was happiest
torturing animals

87
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:26,091
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

88
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:28,093
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

89
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,029
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

90
00:07:32,766 --> 00:07:35,667
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

91
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,536
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

92
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,538
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

93
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:41,673
But I would have been
the queen.

94
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,575
Our alliance
with the Lannisters

95
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,211
remains every bit
as necessary to them

96
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,714
as it is unpleasant
for us.

97
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:51,717
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

98
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,820
The next one
should be easier.

99
00:08:04,531 --> 00:08:06,431
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

100
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,836
Do you know
what that means?

101
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:16,441
I'm not trying
to trick you.

102
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,611
It means I'll become king.

103
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:22,047
Yes, you will
become king.

104
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:25,350
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

105
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:28,120
A good king?

106
00:08:28,154 --> 00:08:30,489
Mm, I think so as well.

107
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:35,060
You've got the right
temperament for it.

108
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:38,864
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

109
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,301
What is a good king's
single most important quality?

110
00:08:42,335 --> 00:08:44,503
This is hardly
the place or the time.

111
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,471
Holiness?

112
00:08:46,506 --> 00:08:48,674
Hmm.

113
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,010
<i>Baelor the Blessed</i>
<i>was holy.</i>

114
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:54,246
And pious.

115
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,882
He built this sept.

116
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,219
He also named
a six-year-old boy high septon

117
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,555
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

118
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:07,626
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

119
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,761
because food
was of this world

120
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,030
and this world
was sinful.

121
00:09:14,434 --> 00:09:15,968
Justice.

122
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,736
Yeah.

123
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,072
A good king
must be just.

124
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,941
Orys I was just.

125
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,445
Everyone applauded
his reforms.

126
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:28,480
Nobles and commoners alike.

127
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,649
But he wasn't just for long.

128
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:32,718
He was murdered
in his sleep

129
00:09:32,752 --> 00:09:34,987
after less than a year
by his own brother.

130
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:38,257
Was that truly
just of him?

131
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:40,525
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

132
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,728
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

133
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,097
- No.
- No.

134
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:50,335
- What about strength?
- Yes.

135
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,704
Strength.

136
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,907
King Robert was strong.

137
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:57,442
He won the rebellion

138
00:09:57,477 --> 00:10:01,079
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

139
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:03,982
And he attended three
small council meetings

140
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,851
in 17 years.

141
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:10,389
<i>He spent his time</i>
<i>whoring and hunting and drinking</i>

142
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,925
until the last two
killed him.

143
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:17,396
<i>So, we have a man</i>
<i>who starves himself to death,</i>

144
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,933
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

145
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:24,603
and a man who thinks that winning
and ruling are the same thing.

146
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:29,641
What do they all lack?

147
00:10:34,113 --> 00:10:35,948
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

148
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:38,016
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

149
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:39,651
Yes.

150
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:42,387
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

151
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,259
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

152
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:49,061
<i>asks you</i>
<i>for your protection</i>

153
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:52,064
against another house
with a strong navy

154
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:54,499
that could one day
oppose you.

155
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:58,003
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

156
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,974
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

157
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,076
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

158
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,145
- No.
- <i>No. Of course not.</i>

159
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,649
A wise king knows what he
knows and what he doesn't.

160
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,384
You're young.

161
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:15,887
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

162
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:19,558
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

163
00:11:19,592 --> 00:11:21,460
And the wisest kings

164
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:25,397
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

165
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,100
Your brother was not
a wise king.

166
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:30,635
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

167
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,537
<i>If he had been,</i>

168
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:35,407
perhaps he'd still
be alive.

169
00:11:35,441 --> 00:11:38,577
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

170
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,846
Do you understand why?

171
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,614
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

172
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:44,483
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

173
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:48,186
To further
the family line.

174
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:51,490
- <i>Do you know how that happens?</i>
- Yes.

175
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:55,360
Yes, but has anyone
explained the details to you?

176
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:56,962
I don't think so.

177
00:11:56,996 --> 00:12:00,365
It's all relatively
straightforward.

178
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,701
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

179
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:04,936
You are.
You will be.

180
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,205
I'll see to that.

181
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,479
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

182
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,515
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

183
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,917
( snaps fingers )

184
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,505
( doors echo shut )

185
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:47,946
It was Tyrion.

186
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,982
He killed him.

187
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,920
He told me he would.

188
00:12:56,422 --> 00:13:00,092
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

189
00:13:00,126 --> 00:13:03,795
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

190
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,900
That's what he said
to me.

191
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,940
You saw it.

192
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:17,642
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

193
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,678
I don't know
what I saw.

194
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:24,649
Avenge him.

195
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:27,185
Avenge our son.

196
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:30,122
Kill Tyrion.

197
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,926
Tyrion's my brother.

198
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,828
<i>Our brother.</i>

199
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,331
There'll be a trial. We'll get
to the truth of what happened.

200
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,833
I don't want a trial.

201
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:45,337
He'll squirm his way to freedom
given the chance.

202
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:47,105
I want him dead.

203
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,010
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

204
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:54,379
You have to.

205
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:57,983
He was our son.

206
00:13:58,017 --> 00:14:00,352
Our baby boy.

207
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,344
( gasps )

208
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,893
You're a hateful woman.

209
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:45,197
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

210
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,574
Jaime, not here,
please.

211
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,108
Please.

212
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,144
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

213
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:02,280
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

214
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:04,783
Stop it.
Stop.

215
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,389
Stop.

216
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:21,600
- Stop. It's not right.
- ( grunts )

217
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:24,469
It's not right.
It's not right.

218
00:15:24,503 --> 00:15:26,404
- I don't care.
- ( crying )

219
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:28,506
- Don't.
- I don't care.

220
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,809
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

221
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:33,111
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

222
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,046
Gonna rain soon.

223
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:37,282
( urinating )

224
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,451
Where are we?

225
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:44,489
Near Fairmarket,
I think.

226
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:45,991
You think?

227
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,392
You don't have a map?

228
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:50,629
- <i>No, I don't have a map.</i>
- Maybe we should get one.

229
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,765
Just point out the next map shop
you see and I'll buy you one.

230
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,667
How far is it
to the Eyrie?

231
00:15:55,735 --> 00:15:56,555
Far.

232
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,533
And you're sure we're
going the right way?

233
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:01,840
Believe me, girl, I want you there
as soon as I can.

234
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,676
Get my gold,
be on my way.

235
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,679
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

236
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,289
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

237
00:16:17,323 --> 00:16:19,557
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

238
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:24,229
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

239
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:25,797
I'd like to see
Braavos one day.

240
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,133
Why Braavos?

241
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,801
I have friends there.

242
00:16:29,835 --> 00:16:32,003
( blows )
I doubt it.

243
00:16:32,038 --> 00:16:34,348
Seven blessings
to you.

244
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:37,750
What do you want?

245
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,957
What do I want?
This is my land.

246
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,147
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

247
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:45,784
We were just watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

248
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:51,423
Forgive my father.

249
00:16:51,457 --> 00:16:53,992
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

250
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:57,362
Our cottage burned down while
he was gone and my mother with it.

251
00:17:00,766 --> 00:17:02,701
He's never been the same.

252
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,141
Which house did he
fight for?

253
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,815
The Tullys of Riverrun.

254
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,387
There's a storm coming.

255
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:23,922
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

256
00:17:23,956 --> 00:17:26,157
<i>There's fresh hay</i>
<i>in the barn.</i>

257
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:29,361
And Sally here makes rabbit stew
just like her mom used to do.

258
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,631
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

259
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,834
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

260
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:41,106
- <i>( thunder rumbling )</i>
- <i>( rain pattering )</i>

261
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:43,641
Man: <i>We ask the Father</i>
<i>to judge us with mercy</i>

262
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,643
<i>accepting our</i>
<i>human frailty.</i>

263
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,612
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

264
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,715
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

265
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,951
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

266
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,153
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

267
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:57,455
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

268
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,170
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

269
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,059
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

270
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,428
Father!

271
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,967
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

272
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:12,070
and our backs so we may finish
the work required of us.

273
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:16,307
We ask the Crone to guide us on our
journey from darkness to darkness.

274
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:18,576
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

275
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,112
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

276
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,887
I'm so sorry.

277
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:33,425
( slurping loudly )

278
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,874
Really good.

279
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,043
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

280
00:18:52,077 --> 00:18:54,479
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

281
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:56,714
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

282
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:59,584
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

283
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:03,121
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

284
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:05,323
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

285
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,992
It means something
to me.

286
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:10,528
The gods will have
their vengeance.

287
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:13,598
Frey will burn in the seventh hell
for what he did.

288
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,935
Things were different when Hoster
Tully ruled the Riverlands.

289
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:19,737
We had good years
and bad years, same as anyone.

290
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:22,607
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

291
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:26,711
raiders come plundering,
steal our food, steal our silver.

292
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,746
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

293
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:31,950
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

294
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,852
You got any ale?

295
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,988
Afraid not.

296
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,627
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

297
00:19:44,363 --> 00:19:47,365
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

298
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,934
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

299
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,838
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

300
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:56,508
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

301
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:59,277
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

302
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,813
Sally does what she can,

303
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:03,982
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

304
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,150
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

305
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:09,354
one look at you, I'd bet
they'd run the other way.

306
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,690
Meaning no offense.

307
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,832
What'll you pay?

308
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,867
I don't have much.

309
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:26,538
But I have hidden
a bit of silver from the bandits.

310
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:31,543
Fair wages
for fair work?

311
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:39,083
Fair wages
for fair work.

00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,885
- What did you do?!
- <i>Get your horse saddled.</i>

318
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,955
- You told me you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

319
00:21:16,989 --> 00:21:19,724
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

320
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,526
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

321
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,161
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

322
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,929
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

323
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,532
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

324
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:30,234
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

325
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:32,870
They'll both be dead
come winter.

326
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:34,739
Dead men don't need silver.

327
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:38,843
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

328
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:42,080
There's plenty
worse than me.

329
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,449
I just understand
the way things are.

330
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:48,119
How many Starks they got to behead
before you figure it out?

331
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:54,926
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

332
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,728
Horse thief.

333
00:21:56,762 --> 00:21:59,030
Ninth born son.

334
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:00,999
Raper.

335
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:03,301
Thief.
Thief and raper.

336
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:07,005
There he is,
Sam the Slayer.

337
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,740
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

338
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,942
- She's not a whore.
- No?

339
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,444
Maybe I'll give her
a copper tonight and find out.

340
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:20,551
They all think
I'm lying.

341
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,253
About what?

342
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:24,555
Killing the white walker.

343
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,492
You're not lying.

344
00:22:27,526 --> 00:22:29,594
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

345
00:22:31,296 --> 00:22:33,498
But you're the only one
that saw it.

346
00:22:33,532 --> 00:22:35,199
And they all think
you're just a--

347
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:36,467
A what?

348
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:39,537
Well, a wildling.

349
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:42,473
My father hated that word.

350
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:45,877
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

351
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,712
I don't know.

352
00:22:47,746 --> 00:22:51,816
It makes me sound
a bit dangerous, doesn't it?

353
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:05,296
So...

354
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,031
are you all right?

355
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,634
No one bothering you?

356
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,269
I get a lot of looks.

357
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,404
I hear them making
their jokes.

358
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:16,407
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

359
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,644
I worry about
it sometimes.

360
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:21,946
All the time.

361
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,982
Why do you worry
about it?

362
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:28,052
100 men, one woman.

363
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:30,421
They've got other things
to think about.

364
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,990
That's the only thing
they think about.

365
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:35,560
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

366
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:39,697
There's 100 men lying awake
at night picturing you.

367
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,701
What about you?

368
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,004
What about me?

369
00:23:49,808 --> 00:23:52,110
Gilly?

370
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,883
I worry about you.

371
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:05,623
Thank you.

372
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:06,891
For what?

373
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,293
For worrying
about me.

374
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:16,267
I don't know
if you're safe here.

375
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,436
They're my brothers,

376
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,872
but some of them were thieves
before they came here.

377
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:22,507
Some of them were rapers.

378
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:25,343
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

379
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:28,780
So what are you saying?

380
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,220
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

381
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,094
Are you bored of me?

382
00:24:43,128 --> 00:24:45,897
Bored of you?

383
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,366
I...

384
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,838
I want to protect you.

385
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,180
I'll get these to Hobb.

386
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,582
Keep an eye
on little Sam.

Your Grace.

390

You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

391
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:53,097
- Joffrey?
- The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.

392
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:56,467
<i>I said those words when I </i>
<i>tossed a leech into the fire.</i>

393
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:59,270
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

394
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,672
A bastard you set free.

395
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:04,308
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

396
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:06,143
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

397
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:07,945
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

398
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,481
- I've been working day and night--
- What progress have you made?

399
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,516
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

400
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,218
House Peasebury.

401
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:17,521
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

402
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:19,891
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

404
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:27,899
They don't have enough men
between them to raid a pantry.

405
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:31,469
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

406
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:33,271
We need to look east
for ships and men.

407
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:36,607
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

408
00:26:36,642 --> 00:26:38,643
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken a contract.

409
00:26:38,677 --> 00:26:40,077
They're sellswords.

410
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,812
We're willing to use blood magic
to put you on the throne,

411
00:26:41,847 --> 00:26:43,614
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

412
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,050
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

413
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,286
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

414
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,155
but I've never heard of visions
and prophecies winning a war.

415
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:53,524
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

416
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:54,859
It's dirty on the ground.

417
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,761
We don't have any gold.

418
00:26:56,795 --> 00:26:57,995
Not yet.

419
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,068
If I do not
press my claim,

420
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:06,170
my claim
will be forgotten.

421
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:09,740
I will not become a page
in someone else's history book.

422
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,977
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

423
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:16,147
Which means you're
running out of time.

424
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:21,118
<i>( knocking )</i>

425

I'm sorry, Princess.

427
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,123
I thought you
weren't coming.

428
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,793
The Hand of the King
doesn't have much leisure time.

429
00:27:28,827 --> 00:27:30,551
You won't be a very good
Hand if you see the word

430
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:32,496
knight and say "ka-nigit."

431
00:27:32,497 --> 00:27:33,931
That happened once,
weeks ago.

432
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:36,000
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

433
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,002
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

434
00:27:38,036 --> 00:27:40,638
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

435
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,873
But I think you can manage.

436
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,144
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

437
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:49,380
That's how children do it.

440
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,927
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

441
00:28:02,961 --> 00:28:06,263
I like this one. It's full
of sword fights and pirates.

442
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:07,999
You were a pirate once.

443
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,900
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

444
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,135
What's the difference?

445
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:13,137
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

446
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:14,805
you're not doing it right.

447
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,607
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

448
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,342
Your father lacks
an appreciation

449
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,611
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

450
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:22,813
So do the Braavosi.

451
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:24,515
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

452
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,351
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

453
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,900
I tried to explain to him

454
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,405
the difference between
pirates and smugglers,

455
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:35,526
but he didn't seem any more interested
in the distinction than your father.

456
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,261
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

457
00:28:37,295 --> 00:28:39,764
and each one of your gold barges
is worth half a kingdom,

458
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:43,768
you tend not to be overly
concerned with the kind of distinction--

459
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,588
- What was that for?
- I need you to write a message.

460
00:29:04,623 --> 00:29:06,757
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

461
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,325
It's too important for me.

462
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,562
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

463
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:15,666
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

464

the one true king of Westeros.

But that's not you.

466
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,740
I need to get
their attention.

467
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:25,476
Go on. Write.

That the daddy?

475
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,018
No.

476
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:09,587
Where's the daddy?

477
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:12,123
He's dead.

478
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:15,092
Oh. Where you from?

479
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:18,762
North of here.

480
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,031
North of here?

481
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:27,071
You a fucking wildling?

482
00:30:27,105 --> 00:30:29,940
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

483
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:32,643
She'll clean and cook

484
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:34,197
and look after the other
girls' babies.

485
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:37,047
Could find other
work for her, too.

486
00:30:37,082 --> 00:30:39,650
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

487
00:30:39,684 --> 00:30:41,318
Give you a piece of it.

488
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:43,821
No other work.

489
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:08,145
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

490
00:31:11,516 --> 00:31:13,684
You'll be safer here.

491
00:31:13,718 --> 00:31:15,853
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

492
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:18,989
You protected me
north of the Wall.

493
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,891
This is different.

494
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:22,366
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

495
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:24,195
and I can't just stab
them in the back

496
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:27,364
and I can't run away,
which is what we did at Craster's.

497
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:29,366
( baby crying )

498
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:32,403
You have to trust me.

499
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,071
It's for the best.

500
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:40,644
Best for you.

501
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,214
Oh, Gilly.

502
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,450
Please don't.

503
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:48,385
( baby crying )

504
00:31:58,196 --> 00:32:01,232
( moaning )

505
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:21,485
Greedy.

506
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,760
No?

507
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,629
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

508
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,597
I just never
acquired the taste.

509
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:36,233
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

510
00:32:36,268 --> 00:32:39,937
That's quite all right, lover.
It's more for you.

511
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:45,075
Your loss.

512
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:52,716
You like them
both the same?

513
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:54,952
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

514
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,654
Everyone has a preference.

515
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,456
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

516
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:04,395
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

517
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:06,230
The gods made this

518
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:08,198
and it delights me.

519
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,235
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

520
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:15,039
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

521
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:17,408
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

522
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,109
What are you, 25?

523
00:33:19,144 --> 00:33:22,346
- Children.
- ( chuckles )

524
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,815
Someday,
if you're lucky,

525
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,617
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

526
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,652
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

527
00:33:28,687 --> 00:33:32,089
Your belly will grow soft
and your back will ache in the night

528
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:36,193
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

529
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,595
<i>No one will want</i>
<i>you anymore.</i>

530
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,832
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

531
00:33:43,268 --> 00:33:44,835
Did you?

532
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:47,938
He is a prince of Dorne.

533
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:50,874
Girls and boys
will line up

534
00:33:50,909 --> 00:33:53,844
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

535
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:59,516
They will all have
to line up behind you.

536
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:02,086
<i>( door opens )</i>

537
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:07,725
- <i>Prince Oberyn.</i>
- Lord Tywin.

538
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,027
May we have the room?

539
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,799
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

540
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,212
Would you like
to sit?

541
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,581
No, thank you.

542
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:32,182
Some wine?

543
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,218
<i>No, thank you.</i>

544
00:34:34,252 --> 00:34:36,019
<i>( door closes )</i>

545
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:38,722
- I'm sorry about your grandson.
- Are you?

546
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:42,793
I don't believe that a child is
responsible for the sins of his father.

547
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:45,496
Or his grandfather.

548
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,765
An awful way to die.

549
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,000
Which way is that?

550
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:53,237
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

551
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:54,772
Some believe
the king choked.

552
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,274
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

553
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:59,877
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

554
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,081
The king was poisoned.

555
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:07,184
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

556
00:35:07,218 --> 00:35:09,586
I did.
This is why I know.

557
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:13,090
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

558
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:16,126
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

559
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:19,930
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

560
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,298
Rather suspicious.

561
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:23,233
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

562
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:25,736
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

563
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,005
on the day
that you arrived.

564
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,306
What did you discuss?

565
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,375
You think
we conspired together?

566
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:32,776
What did you discuss?

567
00:35:32,811 --> 00:35:36,180
The death of my sister.

568
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,848
For which you blame me.

569
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:40,050
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

570
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:42,920
The Mountain follows
your orders.

571
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,555
Of course I blame you.

572
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,024
Here I stand unarmed,
unguarded.

573
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:48,659
Should I be concerned?

574
00:35:48,693 --> 00:35:52,296
You are unarmed and unguarded
because you know me better than that.

575
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,865
I am a man of reason.

576
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,867
If I cut
your throat today,

577
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,569
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

578
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:00,637
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

579
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,473
without their
superiors' knowledge.

580
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:05,008
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

581
00:36:05,043 --> 00:36:07,778
Categorically.

582
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:19,356
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

583
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,192
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

584
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:25,095
He might not enjoy it as much
as he thinks he would.

585
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:29,666
I could arrange
for this meeting.

586
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:33,470
But you want
something in return.

587
00:36:33,505 --> 00:36:36,073
There will be a trial
for my son.

588
00:36:36,107 --> 00:36:38,175
And as custom dictates,

589
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:41,111
three judges
will render a verdict.

590
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:42,546
I will preside.

591
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,749
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

592
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:48,085
I would like you
to be the third.

593
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,987
Why?

594
00:36:50,021 --> 00:36:53,524
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

595
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:56,460
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

596
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:58,629
Now they are
our strongest allies.

597
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,864
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

598
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:04,635
Asking me to judge at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

599
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:08,505
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

600
00:37:08,573 --> 00:37:12,175
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

601
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:22,586
I never realized you had such respect
for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

602
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:26,223
We are not the Seven Kingdoms
until Dorne returns to the fold.

603
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:30,027
The king is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.

604
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:33,297
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

605
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:37,768
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

606
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,873
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

607
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:45,776
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

608
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,645
Aegon Targaryen
and his dragons.

609
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,548
You're saying
you need us?

610
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,686
That must be hard
for you to admit.

611
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,655
We need each other.

612
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,392
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

613
00:38:02,427 --> 00:38:05,395
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

614
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:19,910
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

615
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:26,116
Podrick.

616
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:28,986
Apologies for the stench.

617
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,455
I brought you some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

618
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,256
A noble effort.

619
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,592
They didn't find
the candles, though.

620
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:37,894
A quill, some parchment,

621
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:40,731
duck sausage,
almonds,

622
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:43,834
and some hard cheese.

623
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,636
You're a good lad.

624
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,738
Any word of Shae?

625
00:38:47,772 --> 00:38:49,373
I've heard nothing,
my lord.

626
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:52,142
I suppose
that's a good thing.

627
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:56,046
What are they
saying about me out there?

628
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,116
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

629
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,917
for murdering the king.

630
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:03,120
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

631
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:04,988
No, my lord.

632
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:06,857
You didn't?

633
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:09,593
No. Gods, no.

634
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,795
The world is a better
place without him,

635
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:14,064
but I had nothing
to do with it.

636
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:16,133
I would like to think

637
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,268
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

638
00:39:18,302 --> 00:39:20,804
I'd plan it in such a way that
I wouldn't be standing there

639
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:23,940
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

640
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,045
Trial in a fortnight.

641
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,514
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

642
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:35,952
- Your father.
- Of course.

643
00:39:35,987 --> 00:39:38,522
Mace Tyrell.

644
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,825
Who will vote exactly
as my father tells him to vote.

645
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:44,294
And Prince Oberyn
of Dorne.

646
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:46,229
Oberyn?

647
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,598
Give it to my father.

648
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:51,368
He never fails to take advantage
of a family tragedy.

649
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:54,671
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

650
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:57,708
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

651
00:39:57,742 --> 00:40:00,177
Oh, I can call
my own witnesses?

652
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:01,745
<i>How generous of them.</i>

653
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:03,747
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

654
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:05,449
My lord, she's gone.

655
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:06,663
Gone?

656
00:40:06,688 --> 00:40:08,549
<i>No one's seen her</i>
<i>since the wedding.</i>

657
00:40:11,889 --> 00:40:14,324
You don't think she...

658
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:21,298
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

659
00:40:21,332 --> 00:40:23,233
but the girl
is no assassin.

660
00:40:23,267 --> 00:40:26,503
Whoever killed the king wanted me
to lose my head for it.

661
00:40:26,537 --> 00:40:30,207
And with my wife's disappearance,
it makes me seem that much more guilty.

662
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,909
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

663
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:34,578
- They'll be following you now.
- Who will?

664
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:37,414
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

665
00:40:37,448 --> 00:40:40,383
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

666
00:40:40,418 --> 00:40:43,820
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

667
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:46,790
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

668
00:40:46,824 --> 00:40:49,626
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

669
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,062
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

670
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:54,664
<i>But say what</i>
<i>you will of Cersei,</i>

671
00:40:54,699 --> 00:40:56,333
she loves her children.

672
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:57,811
She is the only one

673
00:40:57,836 --> 00:41:00,175
I'm certain had nothing
to do with this murder.

674
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:02,439
Which makes it unique

675
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:04,841
as King's Landing
murders go.

676
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,811
Any other witnesses,
my lord?

677
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:09,946
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

678
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,182
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

679
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:14,584
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

680
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:15,952
I've already asked,
my lord.

681
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:17,387
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

682
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:20,490
They say he's a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

683
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:21,925
He's under
investigation himself.

684
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:22,778
And my brother?

685
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:25,462
Will they at least 
allow me to see Jaime?

686
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:28,031
I'll ask, my lord.

687
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,814
There's something else,
my lord.

688
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:47,617
A man,
I didn't know his face,

689
00:41:47,652 --> 00:41:50,253
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

690
00:41:50,288 --> 00:41:53,156
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

691
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:56,693
if I told the judges you'd bought
a poison called the Strangler.

692
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:58,829
Ser Podrick Payne?

693
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:01,498
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

694
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:03,400
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

695
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:06,636
Are you going to
accept their offer?

696
00:42:06,671 --> 00:42:08,505
My lord.

697
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,607
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

698
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,108
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

699
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,910
they'll choose something
less sweet.

700
00:42:13,945 --> 00:42:15,278
You've been good
to me, my lord.

701
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:17,814
Pod, the trial's in
a fortnight.

702
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:19,516
They'll want an answer
before that.

703
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,818
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

704
00:42:23,087 --> 00:42:25,922
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

705
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:28,024
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

706
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,860
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

707
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:32,395
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

708
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:35,465
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving you an order.

709
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,003
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

710
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:42,439
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

711
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:44,407
before it's too late.

712
00:42:44,442 --> 00:42:46,042
Pod!

713
00:42:46,077 --> 00:42:47,978
This is farewell.

714
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:53,083
Farewell, my lord.

715
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:55,919
<i>( door opens )</i>

716
00:42:57,588 --> 00:43:00,223
Pod.

717
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:05,962
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

718
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:14,704
<i>( door closes )</i>

719
00:43:30,054 --> 00:43:31,721
Boy: Mother says
it's time to eat.

720
00:43:31,756 --> 00:43:35,025
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

721
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:36,960
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

722
00:43:36,994 --> 00:43:40,030
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

723
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:41,698
Has she got--

724
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:44,401
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

725
00:43:44,435 --> 00:43:45,835
Guymon!

726
00:43:47,238 --> 00:43:48,905
Hide.

727
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,974
Hide!

728
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,644
( screams )

729
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:57,047
( shouting, screaming )

730
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,588
( grunting )

731
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:43,927
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

732
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:45,829
Yes. Yes.

733
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:55,405
Those your parents?

734
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:58,942
Open your eyes.

735
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:01,911
I'm going to eat them.

736
00:45:01,946 --> 00:45:03,713
Do you hear me?

737
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:06,416
I'm going to eat
your dead mama

738
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:10,020
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

739
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:13,623
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

740
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:24,934
Yarwyck: <i>We need to teach them a lesson</i>
<i>about the way we deal with their kind.</i>

741
00:45:24,969 --> 00:45:26,236
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

742
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,030
Yarwyck: <i>Three dozen bodies</i>
<i>with slit throats</i>

743
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:30,173
<i>tossed off the top</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

744
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:31,351
Seems like that would
be a good lesson.

745
00:45:31,376 --> 00:45:32,342
Aye!

746
00:45:32,343 --> 00:45:35,078
If we go after them,
we'll be giving them what they want.

747
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:37,280
They want to draw us out,

748
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:39,616
pick us off
a few at a time.

749
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,385
We have just over
100 men.

750
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,156
And that's including
stewards and builders.

751
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,692
And me. We can't afford
to lose a single man.

752
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:53,730
We must remember our
first responsibility.

753
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:57,133
We are the watchers
on the Wall.

754
00:45:57,168 --> 00:46:00,136
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

755
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,274
You're a champion
of the common people, Lord Snow.

756
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:07,243
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

757
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,683
Mance Rayder is coming.

758
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:17,720
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

759
00:46:17,755 --> 00:46:20,623
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

760
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:22,725
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

761
00:46:25,896 --> 00:46:29,099
We need to shore up
Castle Black

762
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:32,569
and we need
to defend the Wall.

763
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:35,038
<i>That is our job.</i>

764
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:38,808
<i>( horn blows )</i>

765
00:46:41,345 --> 00:46:43,012
Rangers returning.

766
00:46:49,153 --> 00:46:50,987
Help him.

767
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:56,092
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

768
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:01,698
What took you so long?

769
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:03,633
- We were held up.
- By what?

770
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:05,001
Chains.

771
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:08,738
We were guests of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

772
00:47:08,772 --> 00:47:11,508
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

773
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:13,977
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

774
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:16,412
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

775
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:18,515
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

776
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:20,049
Karl's running things now.

777
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,585
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

778
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,387
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

779
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:25,922
We just went
over this, boy.

780
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:28,458
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

781
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:34,497
I told the wildlings we had over
1,000 men at Castle Black alone.

782
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:40,003
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

783
00:47:40,037 --> 00:47:42,539
How long do you think they'll keep that
information to themselves

784
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:46,009
when the wildlings
are peeling their fingernails off?

785
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:49,679
Mance has all he needs
to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet.

786
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:53,082
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

787
00:47:53,117 --> 00:47:55,685
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

788
00:47:55,719 --> 00:47:59,122
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

789
00:47:59,156 --> 00:48:02,091
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

790
00:48:04,228 --> 00:48:06,596
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

791
00:48:30,988 --> 00:48:34,224
<i>( people murmuring )</i>

792
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,893
Daenerys:
<i>Are they attacking?</i>

793
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:14,163
Jorah:
<i>A single rider.</i>

794
00:49:14,198 --> 00:49:17,333
<i>A champion of Meereen.</i>

795
00:49:17,368 --> 00:49:20,470
<i>They want you to send your</i>
<i>own champion against him.</i>

796
00:49:20,504 --> 00:49:22,605
<i>( cheering )</i>

797
00:49:30,814 --> 00:49:32,582
( horse whinnies )

798
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:43,993
( speaking Valyrian )

799
00:49:46,297 --> 00:49:48,364
What is he doing?

800
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,566
I believe he means to...

801
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:53,336
<i>( city crowd</i>
<i>laughing, cheering )</i>

802
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:54,971
( sighs )

803
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:58,207
( laughing )

804
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:01,844
He says that we're an army
of men without man parts.

805
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:05,048
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

806
00:50:05,082 --> 00:50:07,984
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

807
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:10,987
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

808
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:12,276
They're not meaningless

809
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,490
if half the city you intend
to take is listening to them.

810
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:16,693
<i>( continues speaking Valyrian )</i>

811
00:50:18,395 --> 00:50:21,464
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

812
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:26,002
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

813
00:50:26,036 --> 00:50:27,770
Do I have a champion?

814
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,407
( speaking Valyrian )

815
00:50:37,648 --> 00:50:41,484
Your Grace, I've won more
single combats than any man alive.

816
00:50:41,518 --> 00:50:44,354
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

817
00:50:44,388 --> 00:50:47,824
I've been by your side
longer than any of them, Khaleesi.

818
00:50:47,858 --> 00:50:49,492
Let me stand for you
today as well.

819
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:51,461
You are my most
trusted advisor,

820
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:54,497
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

821
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:56,366
I will not gamble
with your life.

822
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,735
Daario: I was the last
to join your army.

823
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:01,137
I'm not your general
or a member of your Queensguard

824
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:02,405
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

825
00:51:02,439 --> 00:51:05,441
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

826
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:08,111
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

827
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:11,981
Let me kill
this man for you.

828
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,217
Very well.

829
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:15,718
You have quite
an audience.

830
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:18,488
Make it worth
their while.

831
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,958
He is very brave,
Your Grace.

832
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:23,826
Yes, win or lose,

833
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:25,762
<i>as long as the whole</i>
<i>city is watching.</i>

834
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,142
You sure you don't
want a horse?

835
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:40,910
Daario: <i>Why would I want</i>
<i>a horse?</i>

836
00:51:40,944 --> 00:51:43,479
Horses are faster
than men.

837
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:46,416
Horses are dumber
than men.

838

00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,959
Your Grace, if you'd like
to sit, I'm sure that--

8
00:02:49,994 --> 00:02:52,261
We've been here
since midday.

9
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:04,374
Easterners have a difference sense
of time, I've often found.

10
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:08,411
Once I was waiting
for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.

11
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,080
Together, we were
going to run

12
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,616
three shiploads
of the finest--

<i>( doors close )</i>

14
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:43,012
Welcome to the Iron Bank.

15
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:46,315
Please, sit.

16
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:11,407
What can we do
for you, Lord Stannis?

17
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,409
This is Stannis
of the House Baratheon,

18
00:04:13,444 --> 00:04:15,678
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

19
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,648
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

20
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,854
<i>The Iron Throne</i>
<i>is currently occupied</i>

21
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,756
by Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

22
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,291
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

23
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:31,227
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

24
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,930
He shares no blood
with me.

25
00:04:33,964 --> 00:04:37,366
He is a bastard
born of incest.

26
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,435
<i>As was his brother</i>
<i>before him.</i>

27
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,238
Yes, we have heard
this story.

28
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,907
It's not a story.
It's the truth.

29
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,277
The king's grandfather
tells a different story.

30
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:50,713
A story about
a jealous uncle

31
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,949
whose attempts to usurp the throne
from the rightful king

32
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:57,920
cost the Seven Kingdoms
dearly in blood and gold.

33
00:04:57,955 --> 00:04:59,655
Gold you loaned him.

34
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,893
And you feel your blood gives you
a claim on our gold?

35
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:06,562
More than any man living.

36
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,499
Across the Narrow Sea,
your books are filled

37
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,668
with words like
"usurper" and "madman"

38
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:15,204
and "blood right."

39
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:18,374
Here, our books
are filled with numbers.

40
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:20,610
We prefer the stories
they tell.

41
00:05:20,644 --> 00:05:22,545
More plain.

42
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:26,015
Less open
to interpretation.

43
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:31,154
How many fighting men
remain loyal to you?

44
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:32,555
4,000.

45
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:34,557
<i>And how many ships</i>
<i>do you have?</i>

46
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,826
<i>The ones still afloat,</i>
<i>Ser Davos,</i>

47
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:39,328
not at the bottom
of Blackwater Bay.

48
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:42,732
32.

49
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:44,500
And how much wheat
and barley and beef

50
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,869
and pork do you produce
on Dragonstone

51
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:51,674
to feed your 4,000 men
on your 32 ships?

52
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,678
None.

53
00:05:55,712 --> 00:05:58,548
You can see why these numbers
seem unlikely to add up

54
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:01,717
to a happy ending
from our perspective.

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,488
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>we must respectfully</i>

56
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:08,591
<i>decline your request.</i>

57
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,727
<i>But we thank you for paying</i>
<i>us the honor of your visit.</i>

58
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:21,938
My lord.

59
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:24,674
I'm not a lord,
Ser Davos Seaworth.

60
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,843
You would not be
either here.

61
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,778
In Braavos,

62
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:32,048
thieves are not
rewarded with titles.

63
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,616
Well, strictly speaking,
I didn't do the thieving.

64
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,218
That would be the pirates.

65
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:38,654
I just moved what they stole
from one place to another.

66
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:42,191
This is the payment
that was demanded

67
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:43,526
by King Stannis
for my crimes.

68
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,962
I consider it
an honest accounting.

69
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:48,464
He's an honest man
and he's your best chance

70
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:50,933
to get back the money
you've sunk into Westeros.

71
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:53,736
Which is a lot, I imagine.
Wars are expensive.

72
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,104
The war is over.

73
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,607
As long as Stannis lives,
the war is not over.

74
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,609
Who's the real power
in King's Landing?

75
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,777
- Ser Davos...
- Humor me.

76
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:05,414
- <i>Tywin Lannister.</i>
- How old is Tywin Lannister?

77
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,186
67.

78
00:07:06,211 --> 00:07:08,382
67. And when he dies,
who's in command?

79
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,987
A half-grown boy,

80
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:13,289
<i>the product of incest?</i>

81
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:16,125
Cersei Lannister, a queen
whose people despise her?

82
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:18,828
Jaime Lannister, a man best
known for killing the king

83
00:07:18,862 --> 00:07:20,963
<i>he was sworn to protect?</i>

84
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:24,634
When Tywin's gone,
who do you back?

85
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:27,303
That is a problem
for another time.

86
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,572
Begging your pardon,
I think it's a problem for now.

87
00:07:30,974 --> 00:07:33,743
There's only one reliable leader
left in Westeros.

88
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,578
Stannis.

89
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,480
He's got the birthright.

90
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:39,649
He's in his prime.

91
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,384
He's a tried and tested
battle commander.

92
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,653
And he doesn't just talk
about paying people back,

93
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,021
he does it.

94
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:52,128
Saan: <i>The lookout sees a pirate ship</i>
<i>sailing their way.</i>

95
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:54,163
<i>The captain shouts</i>
<i>to his first mate,</i>

96
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:56,032
"Bring me
my red shirt."

97
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:59,035
The first mate brings the red shirt
and the captain puts it on.

98
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,970
And when the pirates
try to board,

99
00:08:01,004 --> 00:08:03,372
the brave captain leads
his men to victory.

100
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:06,776
A few days later,
the lookout screams,

101
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,611
"Two pirate ships!"

102
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:12,448
The crew is shivering
like scared mice.

103
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:14,450
But the courageous
captain hollers,

104
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,285
"Bring me
my red shirt!"

105
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,554
<i>After the battle,</i>
<i>the first mate asks,</i>

106
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:22,425
"Captain, why do you
call for your red shirt before battle?"

107
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:24,026
The captain replies,

108
00:08:24,061 --> 00:08:27,863
"So that if I am stabbed,
you will not see me bleed."

109
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:30,099
The next morning
the lookout screams,

110
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,601
"10 pirate ships!

111
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:35,438
- We are surrounded!"
- ( women laugh )

112
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:37,239
<i>The crew goes silent.</i>

113
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:39,775
<i>They all look</i>
<i>to their brave captain,</i>

114
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,911
<i>waiting for his</i>
<i>usual command.</i>

115
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:43,946
<i>Calm as ever,</i>
<i>the captain bellows...</i>

116
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,382
Women:
"Bring me my brown pants!"

117
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,151
( laughs )

118
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:52,655
You think they ever met a pirate
who didn't tell them that joke?

119
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:56,125
- Davos.
- ( chuckles )

120
00:08:56,193 --> 00:08:58,527
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon
in Dragonstone.

121
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:00,896
Only half rotted.

122
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,432
( laughs )

123
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,601
Join us, my friend.
Join us.

124
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,537
- This is Lhara.
- ( gasps )

125
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:10,139
- And this is--
- I am Lhara.

126
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,874
( squeals )

127
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,376
( laughs )

128
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,845
She's an artist,
this one, truly.

129
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:19,248
No time, I'm afraid.
We sail at sunrise.

130
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:20,683
We?

131
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:22,918
You, me-- we.

132
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,021
( scoffs )

133
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:28,224
Once I thought
this man loved me.

134
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:32,395
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>he despises me.</i>

135
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:36,799
He wants to see me die poor
and alone on some cold--

136
00:09:46,777 --> 00:09:48,411
You won't be alone.

137
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,979
And you won't be poor.

138
00:09:57,754 --> 00:10:00,356
There's a chest of the good
stuff left back at your house.

139
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,258
I gave it to your wife.

140
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:05,528
( women laugh )

141
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,963
You're not my friend,
my friend.

142
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,698
( laughs )

143
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,567
I'll see you at sunrise.

144
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,839
Yara: "I give you until
the full moon

145
00:10:16,873 --> 00:10:20,476
to order all ironborn
scum out of the North

146
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:24,180
<i>and back to those</i>
<i>shit-stained rocks you call home.</i>

147
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:26,215
On the first night
of the full moon,

148
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:29,018
I will hunt down
every islander still on our lands

149
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:30,953
and flay them living,

150
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:33,656
the way I flayed
the 20 ironborn scum

151
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,257
I found
at Winterfell.

152
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:39,128
<i>In the box you'll find</i>
<i>a special gift--</i>

153
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,665
<i>Theon's favorite toy.</i>

154
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:45,468
<i>He cried when I took</i>
<i>it away from him.</i>

155
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,638
<i>Leave the North now</i>
<i>or more boxes will follow</i>

156
00:10:49,673 --> 00:10:51,841

Then it is my honor
to receive you.

My father, one of
Meereen's most respected

287
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:27,035
and beloved citizens,
oversaw the restoration

of its greatest landmarks.

For that,
he has my gratitude.

Your father crucified
innocent children.

My father spoke out
against crucifying those children.

298
00:22:51,527 --> 00:22:54,729
He decried it as a criminal act,
but was overruled.

299
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:58,099
Is it justice to answer
one crime with another?

300

I am sorry you no longer
have a father,

301

but my treatment
of the masters was no crime.

302
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:06,775
You'd be wise
to remember that.

What's done is done.

304
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:12,914
You are the queen
and I am a servant of Meereen.

305
00:23:12,949 --> 00:23:16,618
A servant who does not wish
to see its traditions eradicated.

306
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:19,454
And what traditions
do you speak of?

307
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,489
<i>The tradition</i>
<i>of funeral rite.</i>

308

Proper burial in

My father and 162
noble Meereenese

to those posts,

rotting in the sun.

312
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:46,047
Your Grace, I ask that you
order these men taken down

313
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:48,283
so that they might receive
proper burials.

314
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:52,487
And what of the slave children
these noble Meereenese crucified?

315
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:54,990
They were rotting
in the sun as well.

316
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:58,693
<i>Would you have begged</i>
<i>me for their right to a proper burial?</i>

317
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,429
Your Grace, I cannot defend
the actions of the masters.

318
00:24:01,497 --> 00:24:05,400
I can only speak to you as a son
who loved his father.

319
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:07,669
<i>Let me take his body down.</i>

320
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:10,572
<i>Let me have him brought</i>
<i>to the temple</i>

321
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:12,107
and buried with dignity

322
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,509
so that he might find
peace in the next world.

323
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,416
Bury your father,
Hizdahr zo Loraq.

324
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:28,423
Thank you, my queen.

325
00:24:39,969 --> 00:24:41,403
How many more?

326
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:44,706
There are 212 supplicants
waiting, Your Grace.

327
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:47,542
212?

328
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:57,519
Send the next one in.

329
00:24:59,455 --> 00:25:02,157
These meetings aren't always going
to be this early, are they?

330
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:05,293
I was up late last night.

331
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:09,331
So, does this mean
I am a master of something now?

332
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:11,232
Coins, ships?

333
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:13,501
Lord Tywin and I
already determined

334
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:16,771
that I shall be the Master of Ships
long before you--

335
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,778
Lord Tywin,
it's a great honor

336
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,247
to have been granted a seat on
this council. I--

337
00:25:26,282 --> 00:25:28,283
Tywin: <i>The trial begins</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

338
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,485
We only have the morning
for affairs of state.

339
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,987
Shall we begin?

340
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:34,022
Varys: Sandor Clegane
has been spotted

341
00:25:34,056 --> 00:25:36,858
in the Riverlands,
my lord.

342
00:25:36,892 --> 00:25:38,226
A coward and a traitor.

343
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,530
My birds tell me the Hound
slaughtered five of our soldiers.

344
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:45,266
I believe the phrase
"fuck the king" was uttered.

345
00:25:45,301 --> 00:25:47,068
Disgraceful.

346
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,937
Tywin: <i>What would it take to make</i>
<i>the common soldier</i>

347
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:51,239
stupid enough to try
his luck with the Hound?

348
00:25:51,273 --> 00:25:53,842
10 silver stags
seems a generous bounty.

349
00:25:53,876 --> 00:25:56,711
Make it 100.
What else?

350
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:59,314
More whispers
from the east, my lord.

351
00:25:59,348 --> 00:26:00,882
The Targaryen girl?

352
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:03,718
Daenerys has taken up
residence in Meereen.

353
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:07,355
She has conquered the city
and rules as its queen.

354
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,957
Conquered with what?

355
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,925
Varys: <i>She commands an army</i>
<i>of Unsullied, my queen.</i>

356
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,961
Some 8,000 strong.

357
00:26:12,995 --> 00:26:15,296
She has a company
of sellswords--

358
00:26:15,331 --> 00:26:16,698
the Second Sons.

359
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:19,134
<i>She has two knights</i>
<i>advising her--</i>

360
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:22,437
Jorah Mormont
and Barristan Selmy.

361
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:24,506
And she has
three dragons.

362
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,940
Baby dragons.

363
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,109
Larger every year,
Your Grace.

364
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:31,613
Mormont is spying
on her for us.

365
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,616
No longer. He appears
to be fully devoted to her.

366
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:37,652
As for Ser Barristan,
it would seem

367
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:40,321
he took his dismissal
from the Kingsguard

368
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:42,157
a bit harder
than anticipated.

369
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:44,092
He's an old man.

370
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:46,027
He wasn't fit
to protect my son.

371
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,096
Joffrey didn't die
on his watch.

372
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,433
Dismissing him was as insulting
as it was stupid.

373
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:54,569
Don't tell me you're worried about
a child halfway across the world.

374
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:58,173
A child with two
seasoned warriors counseling her

375
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:01,443
and a powerful army
at her back, Your Grace.

376
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:03,511
Lord Varys is right.

377
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:06,047
I have been to Essos
and seen the Unsullied firsthand.

378
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,584
They are very impressive
on the battlefield.

379
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,352
Less so in the bedroom.

380
00:27:11,387 --> 00:27:14,155
Dragons haven't won
a war in 300 years.

381
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,724
Armies win them
all the time.

382
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,993
She must be dealt with.

383
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,062
How, my lord?

384
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,430
By force?

385
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:24,499
Eventually,
if it comes to that.

386
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:29,604
Can your little birds
find their way into Meereen?

387
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:31,639
Most certainly,
my Lord Hand.

388
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:34,609
Mmm. Lord Tyrell,
be a good man.

389
00:27:34,643 --> 00:27:36,377
<i>Fetch my quill and paper.</i>

390
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,192
<i>( footsteps )</i>

391
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:59,434
Prince Oberyn.

392
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:01,870
Lord Varys...

393
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:05,106
Only Varys.
I'm not actually a nobleman.

394
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,675
No one is under obligation
to call me lord.

395
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,544
And yet everyone does.

396
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:14,516
You seem quite knowledgeable
about the Unsullied.

397
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,484
Did you spend much time
in Essos?

398
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:19,187
Five years.

399
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,822
May I ask why?

400
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:23,691
'Tis a big
and beautiful world.

401
00:28:23,726 --> 00:28:26,394
Most of us live and die

402
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:28,129
in the same corner
where we were born

403
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:31,065
and never get to see
any of it.

404
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,701
I don't want to be
most of us.

405
00:28:33,736 --> 00:28:35,737
Most of us
aren't princes.

406
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:40,608
( chuckles )
You are from Essos.

407
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,478
Where? Lys?

408
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,514
<i>I have an ear</i>
<i>for accents.</i>

409
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,216
I've lost
my accent entirely.

410
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,751
I have an ear
for that as well.

411
00:28:51,654 --> 00:28:53,821
<i>How did you get here?</i>

412
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:55,456
It's a long story.

413
00:28:55,524 --> 00:28:58,459
One you don't like
telling people.

414
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:01,095
People I trust.

415
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,199
My paramour Ellaria,
she would find you very interesting.

416
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:06,534
You should come to
the brothel and meet her.

417
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:09,604
We brought our own wine,
not the swill they serve here.

418
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:12,807
We have some lovely
boys on retainer, but...

419
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:18,079
You did like boys before?

420
00:29:20,182 --> 00:29:22,050
Really?

421
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,952
Girls? Hmm.

422
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:26,654
I hope you won't be offended when I say
I never would have guessed.

423
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:28,122
Not at all.

424
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:30,992
But I was never interested
in girls, either.

425
00:29:31,026 --> 00:29:33,428
- What then?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

426
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:36,264
Everybody is interested
in something.

427
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:38,066
<i>Not me.</i>

428
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,301
When I see what
desire does to people,

429
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:42,270
what it's done
to this country,

430
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:45,139
I am very glad
to have no part in it.

431
00:29:46,275 --> 00:29:49,611
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>the absence of desire</i>

432
00:29:49,645 --> 00:29:52,747
leaves one free to pursue
other things.

433
00:29:52,781 --> 00:29:54,449
Such as?

434
00:30:19,308 --> 00:30:21,576
<i>( keys clinking )</i>

435
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:32,654
Let me guess,
I've been pardoned.

436
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:50,738
Really?

437
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:53,741
Father's orders.

438
00:30:53,776 --> 00:30:57,545
Well, we mustn't
disappoint Father.

439
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:05,953
( crowd murmuring )

440
00:31:07,923 --> 00:31:09,924
Man:
<i>Kingslayer!</i>

441
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:59,040
I, Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

442
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:00,808
<i>First of my Name,</i>

443
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:03,144
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

444
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:05,780
and Lord
of the Seven Kingdoms,

445
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:09,550
do hereby recuse myself
from this trial.

446
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:12,720
Tywin of the House Lannister,
Hand of the King,

447
00:32:12,755 --> 00:32:16,657
Protector of the Realm,
will sit as judge in my stead.

448
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,595
And with him Prince Oberyn
of the House Martell

449
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:23,931
<i>and Lord Mace</i>
<i>of the House Tyrell.</i>

450
00:32:23,966 --> 00:32:26,334
And if found guilty...

451
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:30,238
may the gods
punish the accused.

452
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,242
Tyrion of
the House Lannister,

453
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:12,380
you stand accused by
the Queen Regent of regicide.

454
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:16,050
Did you kill King Joffrey?

455
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,653
No.

456
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:21,022
Did your wife,
the Lady Sansa?

457
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:23,491
Not that I know of.

458
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:26,828
How would you say
he died, then?

459
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:29,030
Choked on his pigeon pie.

460
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:32,500
So you would
blame the bakers?

461
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:34,936
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.

462
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,904
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

463
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:40,875
The crown may call
its first witness.

464
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:43,044
Once we'd got
King Joffrey safely away

465
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:45,046
from the mob,
the Imp rounded on him.

466
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,415
He slapped the king
across the face

467
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:49,917
and called him a vicious
idiot and a fool.

468
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:51,552
( crowd gasps )

469
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,688
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>
<i>the Imp threatened Joffrey.</i>

470
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,623
Right here
in this throne room,

471
00:33:55,657 --> 00:33:58,526
he marched up those steps
and called our king a halfwit.

472
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,862
<i>Compared His Grace</i>
<i>to the Mad King</i>

473
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,697
<i>and suggested he'd meet</i>
<i>the same fate.</i>

474
00:34:02,731 --> 00:34:04,532
And when I spoke
in the king's defense,

475
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:06,901
he threatened
to have me killed.

476
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:08,936
Oh, why don't you tell
them what Joffrey was doing?

477
00:34:08,971 --> 00:34:11,772
- Tywin: <i>Silence.</i>
- Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark

478
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,441
while you tore
at her clothes and beat her.

479
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:16,177
Silence!

480
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:20,114
You will not speak
unless called upon.

481
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,651
You're dismissed,
Ser Meryn.

482
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:32,760
Basilisk venom,

483
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:35,296
widow's blood,

484
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,565
wolfsbane,

485
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,800
essence of nightshade,

486
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:42,703
sweetsleep,

487
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:44,839
tears of Lys,

488
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:47,108
demon's dance...

489
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:49,277
( mumbling )

490
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:50,845
blind eye--

491
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,080
I think you have
made your point, Grand Maester.

492
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:54,949
You have a lot of poison
in your store.

493
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:56,984
<i>Had,</i> Prince Oberyn.

494
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:59,921
My stores were plundered.

495
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:01,255
By whom?

496
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,158
Pycelle: <i>By the accused,</i>
<i>Tyrion Lannister,</i>

497
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:06,594
after he had me
wrongfully imprisoned.

498
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:09,130
Tywin:
<i>Grand Maester,</i>

499
00:35:09,164 --> 00:35:12,166
you examined
King Joffrey's corpse.

500
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,504
Was it without question
poison that killed him?

501
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:19,073
Without question.

502
00:35:19,107 --> 00:35:21,375
<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

503
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,979
This was found on the body
of Dontos Hollard,

504
00:35:25,047 --> 00:35:26,581
the king's fool.

505
00:35:26,615 --> 00:35:30,651
He was last seen
spiriting Sansa Stark,

506
00:35:30,686 --> 00:35:34,422
the wife of the accused,
away from the feast.

507
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:37,892
She wore this necklace

508
00:35:37,926 --> 00:35:40,127
<i>the day of the wedding.</i>

509
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:43,431
<i>Residue of a most rare</i>

510
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:47,435
and terrible poison
was found inside.

511
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:51,439
Was this one of the poisons
stolen from your store?

512
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:54,542
It was.
The Strangler.

513
00:35:54,576 --> 00:35:58,412
A poison few in
the Seven Kingdoms possess.

514
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:03,050
And used to strike down
the most noble child

515
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:05,886
the gods ever put
on this good earth.

516
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:08,522
( crowd murmuring )

517
00:36:13,762 --> 00:36:16,097
Cersei:
<i>"I will hurt you for this.</i>

518
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:18,899
<i>A day will come when you</i>
<i>think you are safe and happy</i>

519
00:36:18,934 --> 00:36:21,335
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth

520
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,471
and you will know
the debt is paid."

521
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:27,108
Your own brother
said this to you?

522
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,278
Shortly before the Battle
of Blackwater Bay.

523
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:35,549
I confronted him about his plans
to put Joffrey on the front lines.

524
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:39,820
As it turned out,
when the attack came,

525
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:42,156
Joff insisted on remaining
at the battlements.

526
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,093
He believed his presence
would inspire the troops.

527
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,196
Tyrion said,

528
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:51,899
"And you will know
the debt is paid."

529
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:54,201
What debt?

530
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:57,171
I discovered
he'd been keeping whores

531
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:59,006
in the Tower of the Hand.

532
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,542
I asked him to confine
his salacious acts

533
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:04,178
<i>to the brothel</i>
<i>where such behavior belongs.</i>

534
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:06,147
He wasn't pleased.

535
00:37:08,784 --> 00:37:10,918
Thank you, Your Grace,

536
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:13,254
for the courage
of your testimony.

537
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:31,305
Mace: <i>Do you remember</i>
<i>the precise nature of this threat?</i>

538
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:33,908
Varys:
<i>I'm afraid I do, my lord.</i>

539
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:37,845
<i>He said, "Perhaps you should speak</i>
<i>more softly to me, then.</i>

540
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,780
Monsters are dangerous

541
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:42,249
and just now kings
are dying like flies."

542
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:45,586
And he said this to you at a meeting
of the small council?

543
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,854
Yes.

544
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:49,990
After we received word
of Robb Stark's death.

545
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:52,293
He didn't seem gladdened
by the news.

546
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:54,795
Perhaps his marriage
to Sansa Stark

547
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:57,264
had made him more sympathetic
to the northern cause.

548
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,533
( crowd murmuring )

549
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:03,738
You're excused,
Lord Varys.

550
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,809
Father, may I ask
the witness one question?

551
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,584
One.

552
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,689
You once said

553
00:38:21,723 --> 00:38:25,459
that without me, this city would have
faced certain defeat.

554
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:29,063
You said the histories
would never mention me,

555
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:31,766
but you would not forget.

556
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:35,703
Have you forgotten,
Lord Varys?

557
00:38:38,473 --> 00:38:40,341
Sadly, my lord,

558
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:43,110
I never forget a thing.

559
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,222
We will adjourn for now.

560
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,193
Toll the bells
in an hour's time.

561
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,395
Guard:
<i>Clear the court!</i>

562
00:39:10,305 --> 00:39:13,240
( crowd chatting )

563
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:23,851
Jaime: <i>You'd condemn</i>
<i>your own son to death?</i>

564
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:26,053
I've condemned no one.
The trial is not over.

565
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:27,588
This isn't a trial.
It's a farce.

566
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:29,924
Cersei has manipulated
everything and you know it.

567
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,392
I know nothing
of the sort.

568
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:33,928
- You've always hated Tyrion.
- He killed his king.

569
00:39:33,962 --> 00:39:35,796
As did I.

570
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,399
Do you know the last order
the Mad King gave me?

571
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:41,302
<i>To bring him your head.</i>

572
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:43,804
I saved your life so you
could murder my brother?

573
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,607
- It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
- Justice?

574
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:49,810
I'm performing my sworn
duty as Hand of the King.

575
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,913
If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be
punished accordingly.

576
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:55,516
- He'll be executed.
- No, he'll be punished accordingly.

577
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:01,121
Once you said family
is what lives on.

578
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:03,157
All that lives on.

579
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:06,694
You told me about a dynasty
that would last 1,000 years.

580
00:40:06,728 --> 00:40:09,597
What happens to your dynasty
when Tyrion dies?

581
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:12,499
I'm a Kingsguard,

582
00:40:12,534 --> 00:40:14,435
forbidden by oath
to carry on the family line.

583
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,170
I'm well aware
of your oath.

584
00:40:16,204 --> 00:40:18,305
What happens to your name?

585
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,709
Who carries the lion banner
into future battles?

586
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,711
Your nephews?

587
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:25,312
Lancel Lannister?

588
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,581
Others whose names
I don't even remember?

589
00:40:27,616 --> 00:40:29,283
What happens to my dynasty

590
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:31,552
if I spare the life
of my grandson's killer?

591
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:34,154
It survives through me.

592
00:40:36,691 --> 00:40:38,525
I'll leave the Kingsguard.

593
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,362
I'll take my place
as your son and heir

594
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:44,265
if you let Tyrion live.

595
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:45,766
Done.

596
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:50,871
When the testimony's concluded
and a guilty verdict rendered,

597
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,640
Tyrion will be given
the chance to speak.

598
00:40:52,674 --> 00:40:56,677
He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him
to join the Night's Watch.

599
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:01,248
<i>In three days' time,</i>
<i>he'll depart for Castle Black</i>

600
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:02,950
<i>and live out his days</i>
<i>at the Wall.</i>

601
00:41:02,984 --> 00:41:05,552
<i>You'll remove your</i>
<i>white cloak immediately.</i>

602
00:41:05,587 --> 00:41:07,554
<i>You will leave</i>
<i>King's Landing</i>

603
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:09,790
<i>to assume your rightful</i>
<i>place at Casterly Rock.</i>

604
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:12,259
You will marry
a suitable woman

605
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:15,329
and father children
named Lannister.

606
00:41:15,363 --> 00:41:19,266
And you'll never turn your back on
your family again.

607
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:25,873
You have my word.

608
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:27,708
And you have mine.

609
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:34,682
<i>( bell tolling )</i>

610
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:53,968
Not going well,
is it?

611
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:56,470
- You're going to be found guilty.
- Oh, you think so?

612
00:41:56,504 --> 00:41:59,273
When you are, you need to enter
a formal plea for mercy

613
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,542
and ask to be sent
to the Wall.

614
00:42:01,576 --> 00:42:03,544
Father's agreed to it.

615
00:42:03,578 --> 00:42:06,313
He'll spare your life and allow you
to join the Night's Watch.

616
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:08,983
Ned Stark was promised
the same thing

617
00:42:09,017 --> 00:42:10,985
<i>and we both know</i>
<i>how that turned out.</i>

618
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,920
Jaime: <i>Father is not Joffrey.</i>
<i>He'll keep his word.</i>

619
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:14,755
How do you know?

620
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,494
Do you trust me?

621
00:42:23,431 --> 00:42:26,033
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.

622
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:28,102
This will all be over soon.

623
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,954
The crown may call
its next witness.

624
00:42:51,393 --> 00:42:54,128
<i>( footsteps )</i>

625
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:23,457
State your name.

626
00:43:23,491 --> 00:43:25,459
Shae.

627
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:27,694
Do you swear
by all the gods

628
00:43:27,729 --> 00:43:30,264
that your testimony
will be true and honest?

629
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:33,167
I swear it.

630
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,968
Do you know this man?

631
00:43:42,644 --> 00:43:45,879
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.

632
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,748
How do you know him?

633
00:43:47,782 --> 00:43:51,051
I was handmaiden
to his wife Lady Sansa.

634
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:55,155
This man stands accused
of murdering King Joffrey.

635
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,391
What do you know of this?

636
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:01,295
I know that he's guilty.

637
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:02,596
( crowd gasps )

638
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,731
He and Sansa
planned it together.

639
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:05,999
( crowd murmuring )

640
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:08,502
Tywin:
<i>Silence!</i>

641
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:11,038
<i>Continue.</i>

642
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:13,974
Shae: <i>She wanted revenge</i>
<i>for her father,</i>

643
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:15,509
<i>her mother, her brother.</i>

644
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:18,312
<i>She blamed their deaths</i>
<i>on the king.</i>

645
00:44:18,346 --> 00:44:20,747
<i>Tyrion was happy to help.</i>

646
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:24,418
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.

647
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:27,488
He hated you, my lord.

648
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:30,691
He stole poison from
the Grand Maester's chamber

649
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:32,559
to put in Joffrey's wine.

650
00:44:32,594 --> 00:44:35,129
Oberyn: <i>How could you possibly</i>
<i>know all this?</i>

651
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:38,966
Why would he reveal
such plans to his wife's maid?

652
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:43,003
I wasn't just her maid.

653
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:47,474
I was his whore.

654
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:50,477
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Mace: <i>I beg your pardon?</i>

655
00:44:50,512 --> 00:44:52,179
You said you were his...

656
00:44:52,213 --> 00:44:54,047
His whore.

657
00:44:56,918 --> 00:44:59,386
How did you come
to be in his service?

658
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,721
He stole me.

659
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:02,256
I was with another man,

660
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:03,824
a knight in
your lordship's army.

661
00:45:03,858 --> 00:45:06,393
But when Tyrion arrived
at the camp,

662
00:45:06,461 --> 00:45:08,629
he sent one of his cutthroats
into our tent.

663
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:13,167
<i>He broke the knight's arm</i>
<i>and brought me to Lord Tyrion.</i>

664
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:15,702
"You belong to me now,"
he said.

665
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:19,673
"I want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world."

666
00:45:19,707 --> 00:45:22,409
( crowd laughs )

667
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:25,145
Silence.
Silence!

668
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,413
<i>( laughing stops )</i>

669
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:28,081
Oberyn:
And did you?

670
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:30,617
Did I what?

671
00:45:30,652 --> 00:45:33,320
Fuck him like it was
his last night in this world.

672
00:45:33,354 --> 00:45:35,322
<i>( crowd laughs )</i>

673
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:37,824
I did everything
he wanted.

674
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,027
Whatever he told me
to do to him.

675
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:41,995
Whatever he felt
like doing to me.

676
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,231
<i>I kissed him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

677
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:45,799
<i>I licked him</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

678
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:48,902
<i>I let him put himself</i>
<i>where he wanted.</i>

679
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:50,837
I was his property.

680
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:53,106
I would wait in his chambers
for hours

681
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,975
so he could use me
when he was bored.

682
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:58,946
He ordered me to call
him "my lion," so I did.

683
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,649
I took his face
in my hands and said,

684
00:46:02,684 --> 00:46:05,719
"I am yours
and you are mine."

685
00:46:05,753 --> 00:46:08,555
( crowd murmuring )

686
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:10,991
Shae.

687
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:16,263
Please don't.

688
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:20,801
I am a whore.

689
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:23,403
<i>Remember?</i>

690
00:46:25,373 --> 00:46:27,407
That was before
he married Sansa.

691
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:30,077
After that,
all he wanted was her.

692
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:32,679
But she wouldn't let him
into her bed.

693
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:36,917
So he promised to kill
King Joffrey for her.

694
00:46:36,951 --> 00:46:38,952
<i>( crowd clamoring )</i>

695
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,128
Father,

696
00:46:48,162 --> 00:46:50,764
I wish to confess.

697
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,302
I wish...
to confess.

<i>( crowd quiets )</i>

699

You wish to confess?

700
00:47:01,843 --> 00:47:03,477
I saved you.

701
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:07,514
I saved this city

702
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:11,051
and all your
worthless lives.

703
00:47:11,085 --> 00:47:14,588
I should have let
Stannis kill you all.

704
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:17,257
- ( clamoring )
- Tywin: Tyrion.

705
00:47:20,094 --> 00:47:22,629
Tywin:
Do you wish to confess?

706
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:28,735
Yes, Father.

707
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,271
I'm guilty.

708
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,274
Guilty. Is that what you
want to hear?

709
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:36,410
You admit you poisoned
the king?

710
00:47:36,444 --> 00:47:39,012
No, of that
I'm innocent.

711
00:47:39,047 --> 00:47:43,050
I'm guilty of a far
more monstrous crime.

712
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:46,553
I am guilty
of being a dwarf.

713
00:47:47,722 --> 00:47:50,157
You are not on trial
for being a dwarf.

714
00:47:50,191 --> 00:47:52,392
Tyrion:
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

715
00:47:52,427 --> 00:47:56,663
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

716
00:47:57,865 --> 00:47:59,566
Have you nothing to say
in your defense?

717
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,001
Tyrion:
<i>Nothing but this--</i>

718
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:03,970
I did not do it.

719
00:48:04,005 --> 00:48:06,940
I did not kill Joffrey,

720
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:09,276
but I wish that I had.

721
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,179
<i>Watching your vicious</i>
<i>bastard die</i>

722

I wish I had enough poison
for the whole pack of you.

726

I would gladly
give my life

Escort the prisoner
back to his cell.

730
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,810
I will not give my life
for Joffrey's murder.

<i>And I know I'll get</i>

So I will let

2
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:11,724
In old times, whenever
Braavos stood in danger,

3
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:15,516
the Titan would step with fire in its eyes,

4
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:19,531
wade into the sea and smash the enemies.

5
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,877
It's just a statue.

6
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:31,502
Haha. Don't be afraid. He's
announcing our arrival.

7
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:36,260
I'm not afraid.

8
00:03:42,861 --> 00:03:45,775
The House of Black and White.

9
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:49,404
This is where you'll find
the man you seek.

10
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:57,018
Here, I leave you.

11
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:08,141
- Thank you for bringing me.
- Any man in Braavos would have done the same.

12
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:13,732
- Valar morghulis.
- Valar dohaeris.

13
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:51,021
Hello.

14
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:56,494
Valar morghulis.

15
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,925
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.

16
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,595
- No one here by that name.
- Please!

17
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:20,105
I've crossed the narrow sea.
I have nowhere else to go.

18
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:24,863
- You have everywhere else to go.
- But wait!

19
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:48,143
Cersei...Walder Frey...

20
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:53,497
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

21
00:05:54,612 --> 00:06:00,114
Cersei...Walder Frey...

22
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:05,393
The Mountain...Meryn Trant.

23
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:06,905
Cersei...

24
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:08,581
Walder Frey...

25
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,277
The Mountain...

26
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:12,469
Meryn Trant.

27
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:15,759
Cersei...

28
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,197
Walder Frey...

29
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:18,881
The Mountain...

30
00:06:19,405 --> 00:06:20,702
Meryn Trant.

31
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,008
Cersei...

32
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,790
Walder Frey...

33
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:29,347
The Mountain...

34
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,660
Meryn Trant...

35
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,320
Must be good food if it's crowded.

36
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:12,134
Ale?

37
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,475
Ale?

38
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:31,414
Before we left, a maester
gave you a raven's scroll.

39
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,648
You are becoming an observant young lady.

40
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,431
My mother used to say "dog
weakens dog's words".

41
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:43,310
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.

42
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,688
So it's good news.

43
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,163
My marriage proposal has been accepted.

44
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,970
I thought you still mourned the
death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.

45
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,111
- Ale?
- I'll have some.

46
00:07:59,536 --> 00:08:02,239
My Lady...

47
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:05,513
- What is it?
- Sansa Stark. Don't look!

48
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:07,899
You sure?

49
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,475
She's dyed her hair, but it's her.

50
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,202
She's sitting with Petyr Baelish.

51
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,240
Littlefinger?

52
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,852
A bunch of knights with them.

53
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,085
Bunch? Bunch...Six? Twenty?

54
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,594
Ten, I think. Too many.

55
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,642
My Lady, I don't think this is...

56
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:21,015
Ready the horses!

57
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,653
We only have one horse.

58
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,087
Find more!

59
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:31,561
Do you like the taste?

60
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:34,280
Don't see what all the fuss is about.

61
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:37,337
Why do men love it so much?

62
00:08:37,457 --> 00:08:39,407
It gives some men courage.

63
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:41,377
Does it give you courage?

64
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:45,381
That's far enough.

65
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:48,712
Lord Baelish.

66
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:50,471
Lady Sansa.

67
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,708
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

68
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:55,228
We've met, with Renly Baratheon.

69
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:57,536
What did he say about you?

70
00:08:58,184 --> 00:08:59,257
He said,

71
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:03,187
Your loyalty came free of charge.

72
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:07,291
Someone appears to have paid
quite a bit for it since then.

73
00:09:20,842 --> 00:09:22,277
Lady Sansa.

74
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,109
Before your mother's death,

75
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,304
I was her sworn sword.

76
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,934
I gave my word I will
find you and protect you.

77
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:32,618
I will shield your back

78
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,934
and keep your counsel,

79
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,641
and give my life for you if needs be.

80
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:39,890
I swear it by the Old Gods and the New.

81
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:43,128
Please, lady Brienne.

82
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,161
No need for such formality.

83
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,806
You were Catelyn Stark's sworn sword.

84
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,739
- I was.
- Strange.

85
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,840
I knew Cat since the time we were children.
She never mentioned you.

86
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,337
It was after Renly's murder.

87
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:56,659
Ah, yes.

88
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,553
You were accused of killing him.

89
00:09:58,673 --> 00:09:59,975
I tried to save him.

90
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:03,066
- But you were accused.
- By men who did not see what happened.

91
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,438
And what did happen?

92
00:10:09,497 --> 00:10:11,325
He was murdered by a shadow.

93
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:14,484
A shadow with the face
of Stannis Baratheon.

94
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,807
A shadow?

95
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:19,776
With a face?

96
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:24,540
This woman swore to protect Renly,

97
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,855
she failed.

98
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,502
She swore to protect your mother,

99
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:29,423
she failed.

100
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:33,508
Why would I want somebody with your
history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?

101
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,506
Why would you have any
saying in her affairs?

102
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:36,990
Because I am her uncle.

103
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,595
I married her Aunt Lysa shortly
before my beloved's untimely death.

104
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,679
We're family now. And you are an outsider.

105
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,870
Forgive me, Lady Brienne.

106
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,917
But experience has made
me wary of outsiders.

107
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,402
Lady Sansa...

108
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,672
- if we can have a word alone...
- No.

109
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,350
- Please, my Lady, if I can explain...
- I saw you at Joffrey's wedding...

110
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,653
bowing to the king.

111
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:58,611
Neither of us wanted to be there.

112
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:03,245
- Sometimes we don't have a choice.
- And sometimes we do.

113
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,488
You should leave.

114
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:10,829
We don't want our new friend
wandering the countryside alone.

115
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,600
The roads in these parts aren't safe.

116
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:14,459
Why don't you stay?

117
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,620
I'm gonna ask you to stay.

118
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,135
Stop! Stop! After him!

119
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:17,779
Podrick!

120
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,217
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

121
00:12:57,654 --> 00:12:59,014
Stop!

122
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:03,614
That's a good boy. Come on.

123
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:04,811
Come on!

124
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:08,653
No, no, no, stop!

125
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:30,486
Guess that means you're unarmed.

126
00:13:31,908 --> 00:13:33,305
Don't! Put that down!

127
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:53,978
Podrick?

128
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:56,011
Yes, my Lady?

129
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,982
You can stand now.

130
00:13:58,682 --> 00:13:59,581
Yes, my Lady.

131
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,181
Sansa Stark?

132
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,437
Wary of strangers, as she should be.

133
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,319
I saw her riding on the
Eastroad with Littlefinger.

134
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,477
- We'll follow them.
- My Lady...

135
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,408
if both Stark girls refused your service,

136
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,691
maybe you're released from your vow.

137
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,152
I swore to their mother
I would protect those girls.

138
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:22,552
They don't want your protection.

139
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:24,143
You think she's safe with Littlefinger?

140
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,038
No, my Lady.

141
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:29,772
Get your horse.

142
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:41,145
A summons from the Queen.

143
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,818
There are only two like it in the world.

144
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:05,423
The one I'm wearing and the
one I gave to Myrcella.

145
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:06,874
It's a threat.

146
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,583
Of course it's a threat.

147
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:13,621
Our daughter is alone in Dorne surrounded
by people who hate our family.

148
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,856
It's a threat,

149
00:15:18,534 --> 00:15:19,270
No note?

150
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,217
They blame us for the death
of Oberyn and his sister.

151
00:15:22,534 --> 00:15:24,117
And every other tragedy that

152
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:25,820
has befallen their accursed country.

153
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,365
I will burn their cities to
the ground if they touch her.

154
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:29,313
Softer.

155
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,146
What?

156
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:31,194
Not so loud.

157
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:34,413
Our daughter is in danger and you're worried
I am speaking too loudly?

158
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,406
No one can know she's our daughter.

159
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,042
Then don't call her your daughter.

160
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,028
You've never been a father to her.

161
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,647
If I was a father to any of my children,
they'd be stoned in the streets.

162
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,169
And what has your caution brought?

163
00:15:48,095 --> 00:15:50,478
Our eldest child murdered
at his own wedding,

164
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:53,372
our only daughter shipped off to Dorne,

165
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:58,878
our baby boy set to marry that
smirking whore from Highgarden!

166
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,286
I'm gonna make things better.

167
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,767
You've never made anything better.

168
00:16:10,864 --> 00:16:12,033
I'm going to Dorne.

169
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,130
And I'm bringing our daughter home.

170
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:18,695
You can't just ask Prince
Doran to give her back.

171
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:20,971
She's promised to his son.

172
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm not going to ask him anything.

173
00:16:23,703 --> 00:16:25,830
You go down there with an army
it's an act of war.

174
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,803
No army.

175
00:16:27,564 --> 00:16:29,160
Do you know where they're keeping her?

176
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,686
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.

177
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,046
I'll find her.

178
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:40,879
Is there anything else, Your Grace?

179
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:45,800
You're going to Dorne.

180
00:16:47,022 --> 00:16:48,806
A one-handed man.

181
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:50,814
Alone.

182
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:53,676
Who said I was going alone?

183
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:04,343
No sunfloweres. I don't like yellow.

184
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,775
Roses are very nice,
definitely roses.

185
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,607
And music. I adore music.

186
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:09,929
But no flutes.

187
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,860
I hate flutes. We can have a harp,
if you like, but no flutes.

188
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,860
Then there's the food.

189
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,113
The food is the most important thing,
don't you agree?

190
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,822
We're gonna need pigeon pies.

191
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:20,420
That's what they eat in the capital,
don't they?

192
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:22,827
Don't they?

193
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:25,490
Don't who?

194
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:28,989
People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

195
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,434
They certainly do, my dear.

196
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:33,036
They certainly do.

197
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:35,831
It's a fine place, isn't it?

198
00:17:36,585 --> 00:17:38,157
A fine place.

199
00:17:38,718 --> 00:17:42,342
I never thought I'd be settling down
in a place like this.

200
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:43,951
You won't.

201
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:46,277
Pardon?

202
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:48,398
We won't get to live at Stokeworth.

203
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:51,460
When mother dies, my sister gets the castle
because she's older.

204
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:53,456
She hates me.

205
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:55,056
She calls me mean names and sometimes

206
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,909
even still she pulls my hair
when mother's not looking.

207
00:18:00,114 --> 00:18:01,386
You know what I think?

208
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,831
I think you're a good person.

209
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,625
And your sister is a mean person.

210
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:07,636
She is.

211
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,540
I've been all over the world

212
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,554
and if there's one thing I've learned,

213
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,086
is that meanness comes around.

214
00:18:17,121 --> 00:18:18,568
People like your sister,

215
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,767
they always get what's coming for them,
eventually.

216
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,250
One way or another.

217
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,884
Who's that?

218
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:33,892
Jaime fucking Lannister.

219
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:37,142
Ser Jaime?

220
00:18:37,262 --> 00:18:38,539
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

221
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,453
I was very sorry to hear about your father.

222
00:18:42,908 --> 00:18:43,657
Thank you.

223
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,937
This is my betrothed, Lollys.

224
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:49,999
A pleasure.

225
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,091
Run along, love.

226
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:03,038
Beautiful young bride you've chosen.

227
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:05,389
When are you planning on getting married?

228
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,481
Just get on with it.

229
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:07,666
On with what?

230
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:08,925
What you're here for.

231
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:12,526
There's no way this little visit
could possibly mean anything good for me.

232
00:19:12,646 --> 00:19:13,774
It's very good for you.

233
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,939
Lollys will be marrying Ser Willys Bracken.

234
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:30,276
Mmm.

235
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:32,882
We've made a deal, your sister and I.

236
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:34,905
I would have advised against that.

237
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:36,123
How is this good for me?

238
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:39,163
Because you're going to come with me
and help me with something important.

239
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:40,703
And when we return...

240
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:44,553
I'm gonna give you a much better girl
and a much better castle.

241
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,060
Return from where?

242
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:51,981
As far south as south goes.

243
00:20:16,265 --> 00:20:18,255
<i>You are my queen.</i>

244
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,253
The prince does not
wish to be disturbed.

245
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,888
Remove yourself from my path

246
00:20:30,923 --> 00:20:32,958
or I'll take that long axe
and I'll shove it up your...

247
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:34,082
<i>Captain...</i>

248
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,328
let her pass.

249
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,354
Your brother was murdered...

250
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,235
and you sit here
in the Water Gardens

251
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,570
staring at the sky
and doing nothing.

252
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:51,140
Oberyn was slain
during a trial by combat

253
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:52,853
by a lord.
That is no murder.

254
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:55,479
- Your brother...
- You don't have to remind me.

255
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:58,720
He was my brother long
before he was anything to you.

256
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,302
What will you know about his death?

257
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:03,025
I will bury him.
I will mourn for him.

258
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,075
And then?

259
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,388
You would have me go to war.

260
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,133
The whole country
would have you go to war.

261
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:10,309
Then we are lucky
the whole country does not decide.

262
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:14,310
The Sand Snakes are with me.

263
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:15,929
We have the love of their people.

264
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:17,182
They will avenge their father

265
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,153
while you sit here
in your chair doing nothing.

266
00:21:25,643 --> 00:21:27,182
Oberyn is dead.

267
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:30,968
And this Lannister girl
skips about the Water Gardens

268
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,293
eating our food,
breathing our air.

269
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:36,854
How many of your
brothers and sisters

270
00:21:36,856 --> 00:21:38,540
do they have to kill?

271
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:41,033
<i>Let me have her.</i>

272
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,063
Let me send her to Cersei
one finger at a time.

273
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,451
I loved my brother.

274
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:52,721
And you made him very happy.

275
00:21:52,756 --> 00:21:55,638
For that, you will always
have a place in my heart.

276
00:21:56,937 --> 00:22:01,335
But we do not mutilate
little girls for vengeance.

277
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,954
Not here.

278
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,989
Not while I rule.

279
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,782
And how long would that be?

280
00:22:24,102 --> 00:22:26,301
The Unsullied are too conspicuous.

281
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:29,031
Anyone can see them coming from a mile off.

282
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:31,674
'Course you haven't found any
Sons of the Harpy.

283
00:22:32,204 --> 00:22:33,599
You haven't, have you?

284
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:38,202
My Second Sons
on the other hand...

285
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:43,133
they drink, they whore,
fight in streets,

286
00:22:43,635 --> 00:22:44,879
they blend in.

287
00:22:44,914 --> 00:22:47,214
They overhear things in taverns.

288
00:22:47,349 --> 00:22:50,797
Follow people from the taverns
to nice quiet alleys.

289
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:55,303
Break a few fingers,
overhear a few more things...

290
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,026
before you know it...

291
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:19,273
No one here.

292
00:23:20,203 --> 00:23:21,371
We go.

293
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,174
In a hurry?

294
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:24,151
You're afraid?

295
00:23:24,186 --> 00:23:26,634
Unsullied fear nothing.

296
00:23:27,254 --> 00:23:28,820
Right.

297
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,332
That's your problem.

298
00:23:30,467 --> 00:23:34,630
You understood fear once, long ago,
but you forgot what it means.

299
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:37,486
Someone who's forgotten fear...

300
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:39,975
has forgotten how to hide.

301
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,725
Fear is useful that way.

302
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:16,680
Sons of the Harpy...

303
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:19,002
they want to put a collar
back on my neck.

304
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:21,437
On all of our necks.
Please, Your Grace...

305
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:23,872
- <i>you must kill him.</i>
- It would send a message.

306
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:26,007
I think you should
exercise restraint...

307
00:24:26,042 --> 00:24:27,185
- <i>Your Grace.</i>
- Why?

308
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,307
Well, for one thing, he
may have valuable information.

309
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:32,497
Well, the Son of the Harpy
has no more valuable information.

310
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:33,673
How do you know that?

311
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,411
Because I questioned him.

312
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:38,406
And the information you did get...
he is young and..

313
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,545
He is born free.

314
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,759
Why should he want
to bring back slavery?

315
00:24:40,794 --> 00:24:41,830
What did it do for him?

316
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:43,330
Perhaps the only thing
that gave him pride

317
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,186
was knowing that there was
someone lower than he was.

318
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:46,554
<i>They pay him.</i>

319
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,789
Great families, afraid to do a thing.

320
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,079
They pay poor men
to do it for them.

321
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,192
And how do you know this?

322
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:52,927
- <i>Everyone know this.</i>
- I don't know it.

323
00:24:52,962 --> 00:24:54,129
<i>And I'm the head of a great family.</i>

324
00:24:54,164 --> 00:24:56,698
<i>We do not know what
this man did or didn't do.</i>

325
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,933
Give him a trial at least.

326
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,454
A fair trial.

327
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:02,440
Show all the citizens of Meereen

328
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:04,999
that you are better than those
who would depose you.

329
00:25:05,234 --> 00:25:06,426
Teach them a better way.

330
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:09,022
I do not know the place
from where old ser comes.

331
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:11,868
Things maybe are different there, I hope.

332
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,540
But here, in Meereen,
before Daenerys Stormborn

333
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:17,107
they own us.

334
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:19,346
So we learn much about them...

335
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:21,526
or we do not live long.

336
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,882
They teach me what they are.

337
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,558
Mercy, fair trial...

338
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,593
these mean nothing to them.

339
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:30,628
All they understand is blood.

340
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:37,467
Thank you all for your council.

341
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,485
<i>Your Grace...</i>

342
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
a word, please, I beg you.

343
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:50,179
About what?

344
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:51,842
About your father.

345
00:25:51,877 --> 00:25:53,877
- About the Mad King.
- The Mad King?

346
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,544
You're here to remind me
of my enemies' lies?

347
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:56,806
Consider me reminded.

348
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,740
Your Grace...

349
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:00,571
I served in his Kingsguard.

350
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,297
I was at his side
from the first.

351
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:05,532
Your enemies did not lie.

352
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,372
Go on.

353
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:13,203
When the people rose
and revolted against him

354
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,734
your father set their tongues
cast them in flames.

355
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,320
He murdered sons
in front of their fathers.

356
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:22,429
He burned men alive
with wildfire

357
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:24,364
and laughed as they screamed,

358
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,851
and his efforts to stamp out dissent

359
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:31,621
led to a rebellion
that killed every Targaryen...

360
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:33,502
except two.

361
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,112
I'm not my father.

362
00:26:36,147 --> 00:26:38,685
No, Your Grace, thank the gods.

363
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:43,811
But the Mad King gave his enemies
the justice he thought they deserved.

364
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:46,726
And each time,
it made him feel powerful...

365
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:48,035
and right...

366
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,394
until the very end.

367
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:58,824
I will not have the Son of the Harpy
executed without a fair trial.

368
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,115
Your Grace.

369
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,380
There's a bug.

370
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:16,889
Yes, best be careful.

371
00:27:16,924 --> 00:27:19,713
You might accidentally
consume some solid food.

372
00:27:19,748 --> 00:27:24,442
When I agreed to come with you,
did I misrepresent my intentions?

373
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:34,018
Besides, what else is there for me
to do inside this fucking box?

374
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,953
- You don't like it?
- I want to take a walk.

375
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,157
You can't.

376
00:27:37,192 --> 00:27:40,389
Cersei has offered a lordship
to the man who brings her your head.

377
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:42,824
She ought to offer her cunt.

378
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:45,159
Best part of her
for the best part of me.

379
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,109
Well, I suppose a box is as good
a place for me as anywhere.

380
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,437
Are we really going to
spend the entire road to Volantis

381
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:54,572
talking about the
futility of everything.

382
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:56,502
You're right, there's no point.

383
00:27:56,893 --> 00:27:58,978
The road to Volantis?

384
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,888
You said we are going to Meereen.
What's in Volantis?

385
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:03,299
The road to Meereen.

386
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:07,118
And what do you hope to find
at the end on the road to Meereen?

387
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,153
I told you.
A ruler.

388
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,388
But you've already got a ruler.

389
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,078
Everywhere has already got a ruler.

390
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:16,653
Every pile of shit
on the side of every road

391
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:18,788
has someone's banner
hanging from it.

392
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,610
You are quite good, do you know?

393
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:22,563
At ruling.

394
00:28:23,178 --> 00:28:25,353
During your brief tenure as Hand.

395
00:28:25,828 --> 00:28:27,288
I didn't rule, I was a servant.

396
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:29,840
Still, a man of talent.

397
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,446
Managed to kill a lot of people?

398
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:35,628
Yes, but you showed great
promise in other areas as well.

399
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:41,044
She wanted me
to leave King's Landing.

400
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,186
She begged me.

401
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,366
I wouldn't go.

402
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:46,556
Why?

403
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,066
'Cause I liked it.

404
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:51,160
Power...

405
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:52,661
even as a servant.

406
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,151
People follow leaders

407
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:57,899
and they will never follow us.

408
00:28:57,934 --> 00:28:59,934
They find us repulsive.

409
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:01,199
I find us repulsive.

410
00:29:01,234 --> 00:29:03,605
And we find them...
repulsive, which is why

411
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,498
we surround ourselves
with large comfortable boxes

412
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,977
to keep them away.

413
00:29:08,806 --> 00:29:10,032
And yet...

414
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,474
no matter what we do...

415
00:29:13,078 --> 00:29:17,579
people like you and me are never
really satisfied inside the box.

416
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:18,898
Not for long.

417
00:29:20,403 --> 00:29:21,531
You're right.

418
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:24,604
- Let's go for a walk.
- No.

419
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,178
How many dwarves
are there in the world?

420
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,832
Is Cersei
going to kill them all?

421
00:29:34,618 --> 00:29:36,303
Not him.

422
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:38,638
You're trying
to deceive your queen?

423
00:29:38,673 --> 00:29:40,773
Should I throw them
in a cell, Your Grace?

424
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:42,448
It won't be necessary,
Ser Meryn.

425
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:44,929
I don't want to dissuade
the other hunters.

426
00:29:45,423 --> 00:29:47,127
Mistakes will be made.

427
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:47,926
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thanks.

428
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:48,782
- Thank you, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

429
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:49,777
Take the head.

430
00:29:49,812 --> 00:29:50,684
Let me, Your Grace.

431
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:52,719
I would take it
if you don't mind.

432
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:54,754
It could prove
useful for my work.

433
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:57,189
Very good.

434
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:01,888
Over there would be fine.

435
00:30:03,357 --> 00:30:05,433
You heard the man, over there.

436
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,147
You're the hand of the King.

437
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:36,635
No, uncle.

438
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,140
Clearly, it would not be appropriate
for a woman to assume that role.

439
00:30:40,408 --> 00:30:44,587
I'm merely advising my son until he comes
of age and chooses a Hand for himself.

440
00:30:44,822 --> 00:30:48,694
Your Grace, I would be willing
to serve provisionally as the King's Hand

441
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:51,358
- until he becomes full...
- You're a good man, Lord Tyrell,

442
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,593
but I don't imagine
we'll have the time.

443
00:30:53,628 --> 00:30:55,843
In addition to be Master of Ships,

444
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:58,794
the King has appointed
you Master of Coin.

445
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:01,053
Oh, Your Grace.

446
00:31:01,088 --> 00:31:05,160
He called your experience and wisdom
in financial matters unparalleled.

447
00:31:05,507 --> 00:31:09,619
He said he would be honored to have you
represent the Crown's interest in the same.

448
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:11,754
The honor is all mine,
Your Grace.

449
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:14,956
<i>Y-Y-Your Grace,
in the past, on several occasions,</i>

450
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:17,648
a Grand Maester has
served as the King's Hand.

451
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:22,147
The King's named Qyburn
the new Master of Whispers.

452
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,578
Your Grace,

453
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:29,978
this-this man?
Th-This embarassment to the Citadel?

454
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:31,613
Your Grace...

455
00:31:32,082 --> 00:31:35,528
what qualifications can he
possibly have for this post?

456
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:38,144
The qualification of loyalty,
Grand Maester.

457
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:40,279
That's far more than
the eunuch ever had.

458
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,869
Far more than many ever have.

459
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,420
I must say...
I can not...

460
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:46,694
Uncle Kevan,

461
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:49,970
in light of your position as
Commander of the Lannister Armies,

462
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:53,407
it would please the King if you
would serve as his Master of War.

463
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,353
No man living
better deserves the title.

464
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:58,452
That is kind of you to say.

465
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:01,359
I would like to hear it
from the King himself.

466
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:02,959
Well, the King is very
busy at this moment.

467
00:32:02,994 --> 00:32:05,528
He should be here,
learning what it means to rule.

468
00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:07,032
He is learning.

469
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,184
On this occasion,
in his capacity as ruler,

470
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,219
he's asked me
to speak on his behalf.

471
00:32:11,777 --> 00:32:15,662
I returned to the capital
to pay my respects to my brother,

472
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:16,776
and to you,

473
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:18,567
and to serve the King.

474
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:22,122
I did not return to the capital
to serve as your puppet.

475
00:32:22,157 --> 00:32:25,663
To watch you stack the
Small Council with sycophants.

476
00:32:26,672 --> 00:32:28,182
Sending your own brother away...

477
00:32:28,217 --> 00:32:32,163
My brother has left the capital
to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.

478
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:33,232
<i>What mission?</i>

479
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:35,591
That is not your concern
as Master of War.

480
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:40,217
I do not recognize
your authority to dictate

481
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,755
what is and is not my concern.

482
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:44,790
You are the Queen Mother.

483
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,076
Nothing more.

484
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:53,037
You would abandon your king
in his time of need?

485
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:56,408
If he wants to send for me,
I'll be waiting for him.

486
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:58,543
At Casterly Rock.

487
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,085
Come on, you know this one.

488
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,228
It looks like an animal.

489
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:15,707
Snake.

490
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:18,628
S-S-Sn...
"S".

491
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,057
- It's an "S".
- <i>Right, very good.</i>

492
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:23,768
Hmm, did you know

493
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:25,523
that the youngest
Lord Commander in history,

494
00:33:25,538 --> 00:33:28,075
Osric Stark,
was elected at the age of 10?

495
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,959
I know "S".

496
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:33,679
You'll learn, I promise.

497
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,423
I taught Ser Davos.

498
00:33:34,425 --> 00:33:36,703
Old people are terrible
at learning new things.

499
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:38,892
Well, you are a wonderful teacher.

500
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:41,622
Very patient.

501
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:44,564
I only said that the more
time that you spend practicing

502
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,664
<i>the faster you will
be able to read.</i>

503
00:33:45,699 --> 00:33:47,112
That's all right.

504
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:48,766
We're doing just fine.

505
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:53,148
I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark
have a lot to talk about.

506
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:58,525
How old were you
when you learned how to read?

507
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,159
- <i>3.</i>
- 3?

508
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:01,693
Were you taught by your mother?

509
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:03,483
No.

510
00:34:03,518 --> 00:34:05,418
Our Maester Cressen did.

511
00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:08,887
I had a lot of time to practice.
My mother kept me inside because...

512
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:15,740
What do you call it in the south?
What happened to your face.

513
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,734
Grayscale.

514
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:19,649
What would you call it
in the north of the Wall?

515
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:21,729
I don't know.

516
00:34:22,473 --> 00:34:25,799
But two of my sisters had it.
They both died.

517
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,535
How did they cure you?

518
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,155
I don't remember.
I was a baby.

519
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,592
A lot of people came and tried, I think.

520
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:34,930
Whatever they did, it went away.

521
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,372
What happened to your sisters?

522
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:44,769
My father made them move out
to the keep, outside.

523
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,392
None of us were allowed
to go near them.

524
00:34:47,762 --> 00:34:51,784
But we heard them,
especially at night.

525
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:56,680
They started to sound
not like themselves.

526
00:34:57,315 --> 00:34:58,684
Did you ever see them?

527
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:01,459
Only once, at the end.

528
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,795
They were covered with it.

529
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:11,281
Their faces, their arms,
they acted like animals.

530
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:15,500
My father had to drag them out
to the woods on a rope.

531
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,202
What did he do with
them in the woods?

532
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,981
Mother.

533
00:35:25,511 --> 00:35:26,787
Leave us.

534
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,192
Your Grace.

535
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,580
You need to stay
away from that girl.

536
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:36,133
- Why?
- She's a wildling.

537
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,414
Her name's Gilly.

538
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:39,249
She's nice.
I'm teaching her to read.

539
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:42,537
She's a wildling.
Your father defeated her people.

540
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:45,189
He executed their king
for treason.

541
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:48,460
They could strike at him
by striking at you.

542
00:35:48,495 --> 00:35:50,166
Gilly wouldn't do that.

543
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,888
You have no idea
what people will do.

544
00:35:55,007 --> 00:35:57,219
All your books
and you still don't know.

545
00:36:03,318 --> 00:36:06,012
I ordered Mance Rayder
burned at the stake.

546
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:08,347
You prevented that order
from being carried out.

547
00:36:08,382 --> 00:36:10,882
You showed mercy
to Mance Rayder.

548
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:12,707
The King's word is law.

549
00:36:13,514 --> 00:36:17,355
Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos
how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.

550
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,083
Show too much kindness,
people won't fear you.

551
00:36:23,118 --> 00:36:25,218
If they don't fear you,
they don't follow you.

552
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,441
With respect, Your Grace,
the free folk will never follow you

553
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:29,781
no matter what you do.

554
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:32,956
You're the man
who burned their king alive.

555
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:34,791
Who then?

556
00:36:36,865 --> 00:36:38,235
You?

557
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,460
No.
Only one of their own.

558
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,195
Do you know this wretched girl?

559
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:49,296
- Lyanna Mormont.
- Lord Commander's niece.

560
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,155
Lady of Bear Island.

561
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,112
And a child of ten.

562
00:36:54,685 --> 00:36:57,561
I asked her to commit her house
to my court. That's her response.

563
00:36:57,817 --> 00:37:00,990
Bear Island knows no king
but the King in the North,

564
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:03,010
whose name is Stark.

565
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,208
That amuses you.

566
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:08,550
I apologize, Your Grace.

567
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:13,189
Northerners commit
a bit like the free folk.

568
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,626
Loyal to their own.

569
00:37:16,043 --> 00:37:17,157
I know.

570
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:20,359
My brother, Robert, went on often
and loudly about how difficult it was

571
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:21,890
to control them.

572
00:37:23,913 --> 00:37:25,910
Even with your father's help.

573
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:31,888
Tonight, the Night's Watch
elect a new Lord Commander.

574
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:34,501
Ser Alliser Thorne
is going to win.

575
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:36,555
- Most likely.
- One pleasant man.

576
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,549
He thinks you're a traitor.

577
00:37:39,736 --> 00:37:41,251
What's your life gonna
be like here at the Wall,

578
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:44,096
- with Thorne in command?
- Unpleasant, I expect.

579
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:45,933
Your bravery made him look weak.

580
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:48,853
He'll punish you for it.

581
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,063
I don't punish men for bravery.

582
00:37:51,098 --> 00:37:52,592
I reward them.

583
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:54,727
I don't doubt that, Your Grace.

584
00:37:55,975 --> 00:37:57,728
But I am a brother
of the Night's Watch.

585
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:00,678
I have pledged them my life,
my honor, my sword.

586
00:38:00,913 --> 00:38:02,813
I don't know what
I have left to give you.

587
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,627
You can give me the North.

588
00:38:06,062 --> 00:38:07,180
I can't.

589
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:11,027
Even if I wanted to,
I'm a bastard.

590
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:12,480
A Snow.

591
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,640
Kneel before me.
Lay your sword at my feet.

592
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:18,539
Pledge me your service
and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,

593
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:20,089
Lord of Winterfell.

594
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,276
He'll make you a Stark
with a stroke of a pen.

595
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,929
It's the first thing
I ever remember wanting.

596
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:35,168
I daydreamed that my father
would ask the king.

597
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:37,601
Just like that I would never be
the Bastard of Winterfell again.

598
00:38:37,636 --> 00:38:40,636
No, you deserve that.
You do.

599
00:38:40,671 --> 00:38:42,830
I-I couldn't be happier for you.

600
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:45,393
I'm gonna refuse him.

601
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,665
But...

602
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,695
you'd be Lord of Winterfell.

603
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:53,496
I swore a vow
to the Night's Watch.

604
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,302
If I don't take
my own word seriously,

605
00:38:55,337 --> 00:38:57,537
what sort of Lord of Winterfell
would that be?

606
00:39:01,278 --> 00:39:02,233
<i>Hey.</i>

607
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:05,910
Crowded,
You'd think we were serving venison stew.

608
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:17,327
Does anyone wish to speak
for candidates...

609
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:20,036
before we cast our tokens...

610
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:26,536
for the 998th Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

611
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:30,743
Ser Alliser Thorne
is not just a knight,

612
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:32,630
he's a man of true nobility.

613
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:35,783
<i>He was Acting Commander
when the Wall came under attack</i>

614
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:37,318
and led us to victory
against the wildlings.

615
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:38,303
<i>Yes.</i>

616
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:39,792
He's a veteran of 100 battles

617
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:43,209
and he's been a defender of the Watch
and the Wall almost all of his life.

618
00:39:43,244 --> 00:39:44,408
<i>Nice.</i>

619
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:46,861
- He's the only true choice.
- <i>Yes.</i>

620
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:48,809
<i>Yes.</i>

621
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:53,945
Ser Denys Mallister
joined the Watch as a boy

622
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,101
and he served loyally
longer than any of the Ranger.

623
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:59,666
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Through ten winters he served.

624
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,627
As Commander of the Shadow Tower...

625
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,661
he kept the wildlings away.

626
00:40:03,781 --> 00:40:05,396
We could do no better.

627
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,302
If there's no one else...

628
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,281
we will begin the voting.

629
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:18,231
The triangular tokens count
for Ser Alliser Thorne.

630
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:22,402
The square token for Ser Denys Mallister.

631
00:40:22,831 --> 00:40:24,878
Maester Aemon...

632
00:40:26,495 --> 00:40:29,702
Samwell Tarly, go on.

633
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:32,197
Sam the Slayer.

634
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:36,831
Another wildling lover,
just like his friend, Jon Snow.

635
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:38,820
How's your lady love, Slayer?

636
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,215
Her name is Gilly.

637
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,585
Ser Slynt knows her quite well.

638
00:40:44,022 --> 00:40:46,663
They cowered together in the larder
during the battle for the Wall.

639
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,344
Lies!

640
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:51,173
A wildling girl, a baby,

641
00:40:51,634 --> 00:40:53,281
and Lord Janos.

642
00:40:54,117 --> 00:40:55,957
I found him there after
the battle was over.

643
00:40:56,077 --> 00:40:57,379
In a puddle of his own making.

644
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,141
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding
with the women and children

645
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:08,299
Jon Snow was leading.

646
00:41:09,524 --> 00:41:11,448
Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true,

647
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:13,763
but when he was wounded,
it was Jon who saved us.

648
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:16,405
He took charge of the Wall's defense,

649
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:18,500
he killed the Magnar of the Thenns,

650
00:41:19,158 --> 00:41:21,399
he went North to deal with Mance Rayder.

651
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:24,469
Knowing it will almost certainly mean
his own death.

652
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,171
Before that,

653
00:41:30,292 --> 00:41:34,044
he lead the mission to avenge
the Lord Commander Mormont.

654
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:38,143
Mormont himself chose
Jon to be his steward.

655
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:39,902
He saw something in Jon.

656
00:41:40,022 --> 00:41:41,872
And now we've all seen it too.

657
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:43,866
He may be young,

658
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:47,177
but he's the commander we turned to

659
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,973
when the night was darkest.

660
00:41:49,093 --> 00:41:50,505
Yeah!

661
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:57,815
Aye.

662
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,073
Can't argue with any of that.

663
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,591
But who does Jon Snow want to command?

664
00:42:04,052 --> 00:42:05,361
The Night's Watch?

665
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,455
Or the wildlings?

666
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:12,627
Everyone knows he loved
a wildling girl.

667
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:14,560
Spoke with Mance Rayder many times.

668
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,050
What would have happened in that tent
between those two old friends

669
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,532
if Stannis's army hadn't come along?

670
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:25,352
We all saw him put the King-Beyond-the-Wall
out of his misery.

671
00:42:25,617 --> 00:42:28,767
Do you want to choose a man who has fought
the wildlings all his life

672
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:31,845
or a man who makes love to them?

673
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:41,116
It is time!

674
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:30,526
Appears to be a tie, maester.

675
00:43:50,988 --> 00:43:52,832
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

676
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:55,271
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

677
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:57,412
Jon Snow! Jon Snow!

678
00:44:25,148 --> 00:44:27,584
You! You!

679
00:44:31,271 --> 00:44:32,465
What have you got there?

680
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:38,215
- I said...
- Turn around and go!

681
00:44:40,505 --> 00:44:42,089
Turn around...

682
00:44:42,552 --> 00:44:44,866
- and go!
- That's a nice little sword.

683
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:47,400
Worth a hundred pigeons a sword like that.

684
00:44:49,836 --> 00:44:52,005
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.

685
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:57,365
Quickly, go! Go!

686
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,296
Who are you?

687
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:14,879
Why were they scared of you?

688
00:45:14,999 --> 00:45:16,438
You lost this.

689
00:45:27,939 --> 00:45:29,913
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.

690
00:45:30,254 --> 00:45:31,472
There isn't.

691
00:45:31,592 --> 00:45:33,689
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.

692
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,099
Who are you then?

693
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:40,560
No one.

694
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,826
And that is who a girl must become.

695
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,102

696
00:46:34,451 --> 00:46:37,694

697
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:41,182
_

698
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:56,797
Why?

699
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,599
_

700
00:47:01,548 --> 00:47:04,228

706
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:22,507

707
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,064
_

708
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:27,384

709
00:47:29,142 --> 00:47:32,401

712
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:45,810
_

713
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:50,378
_

714
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:56,218

715
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,383

716
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,903

717

718
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:17,212

719
00:48:17,332 --> 00:48:18,615

720
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:20,296
_

721
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,020
_

722
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:38,672
Mhysa!

723
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,240
Mhysa!

724
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,486
Mhysa!

725
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,189
Mhysa! Mhysa!

726
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,840
She should have cut the traitor's head
in the Great Pyramid and be done with it.

727
00:49:10,077 --> 00:49:12,023
That's what I keep telling 
her to do to you.

728
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,094
Mhysa!

729
00:49:19,214 --> 00:49:21,764
_

730
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:24,283

739
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,017
Mhysa!

740
00:51:14,257 --> 00:51:15,914
Mhysa!

741
00:52:19,205 --> 00:52:21,714
l'll stand guard outside
your door tonight, Your Grace.

742
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:23,581
We all guard tonight.

743
00:52:24,672 --> 00:52:26,029
Leave me.

744
00:53:18,983 --> 00:53:20,699
Drogon!

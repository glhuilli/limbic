00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:56,157
Get back to work.

7
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:59,235
No. I've been
here for weeks.

8
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:00,737
I'm not scrubbing
one more corpse

until you tell me
why I'm doing it.

You will know why.

11
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:09,546
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

12

When do I get to play the game?

14

Game?

15
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:16,836
The game. The
Game of Faces.

16
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:20,256
You tried already.
You failed.

17

I didn't even know
I was playing.

Who are you?

19
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:25,828
No one.

20
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:28,348
Get back to work.

22

What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

23
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:37,674
I'm from Westeros just like you.

24
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:41,427
Daughter of a
lord just like you.

25
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,264
Except I was an only child.

26
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:47,517
Heir to his fortune.

27
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:50,119
My mother died.

28
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:52,372
My father remarried
and his new wife

29
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:55,275
gave birth to a girl.

30
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:59,862
My stepmother didn't want any
rivals for her precious daughter,

31
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,931
so she tried to kill
me with poison.

32
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,200
I found out.

33
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,469
Sought help from
the Faceless Men.

34
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:11,357
And my father was widowed again.

35
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:15,395
I've been serving
them ever since.

36
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,892
Was that true or a lie?

37
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:34,047
What?

38
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:35,882

Arya.

44
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,259
And where did you come from?

45
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:21,761
<i>Westeros.</i>

46
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,884
My family home is Winterfell.

47
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:30,520
I'm the youngest
daughter of a great lord,

48

Eddard Stark.

49
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:33,389
He died in battle.

50
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,059
A lie.

51
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,162
After he was executed,
I fled the capital.

52
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:42,398
Had to kill a stable boy.

53
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,233
Drove my sword through his back.

(GASPS)

55
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,370
A lie.

56
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,322
I stabbed him in the gut.

57

<i>They were murdered

(WINCES)

62
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:05,088
A man called the
Hound. Sandor Clegane.

63
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,223
He tried to sell me, but
was wounded in a fight.

64
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:09,258
He begged me to kill
him, but I wouldn't.

65
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,394
I left him in the
mountains to die.

66
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:13,896
I wanted him to
suffer. I hated him.

67
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:17,483
I hated him.

68
00:07:19,153 --> 00:07:21,938
That's not a lie!

69
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,941
A girl lies to me,

70
00:07:24,992 --> 00:07:28,444
to the Many-Faced
God, to herself.

71
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,630
Does she truly
want to be no one?

72
00:07:30,698 --> 00:07:32,865
Yes.

73

74
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:40,873
I'm not playing this

We never stop playing.

76
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:08,985
So, those villages we
were supposed to find?

77
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:10,870
We can't live on
berries and roots.

78
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:13,623
I can.

79
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,458

Of course I'm hungry.

81

You're an awful travelling
companion, do you know that?

82
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,582
Possibly the least charming
man I've ever met.

83
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,267
I'm not your
travelling companion.

84
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:27,587
We are travelling together in each
other's company, therefore--

85

Do you ever shut up?

86
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:32,675
I sailed from King's Landing

<i>without ever saying a word.</i>

88

Why?

89
00:08:40,017 --> 00:08:43,019
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

90
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:47,323
You never wondered
why Tyrion Lannister

91
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:50,026
decided to visit a
brothel in Volantis?

92
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:53,029
I'm sure you visited many
brothels in many cities.

93
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,866
I killed my father.

94
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,755
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

95
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,627
And he was fucking
the woman I loved.

As miserable as
you are, Mormont,

97
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,390
at least your father
was a good man.

98
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:23,226
What do you know
about my father?

99
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,813
I met him. I
visited the Wall.

100
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:29,782
When I asked him about his men,

101
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:32,058
he knew all their stories,
every one of them.

102
00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:35,655
He actually cared about the
people under his command.

103
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:39,075
How do they put it in the Watch?

104
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:41,878
"We shall never
see his like again."

105
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:55,057
Oh, you didn't know.

106
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,432
I'm sorry.
I am.

107
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,270
How?

108
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:10,606
I only know what I heard.

109
00:10:10,657 --> 00:10:11,824
How?

110
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:14,443
<i>He was leading an
expedition beyond the Wall.</i>

111
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:18,030
There was a mutiny.

112
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:20,349
He was murdered by his own men.

113

She suffers every
day of her life.

121
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,005
I just want it to end.

122
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,567
It hurts.

123
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:20,987

124

Don't be afraid.

125
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,028
I used to be like you.

126
00:12:29,062 --> 00:12:31,197
I was sick.

127
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:34,467
I was dying.

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,007
But my father never
gave up on me.

129
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:46,212
He loved me

00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:50,633
just like your father loves you.

00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,919
So he brought me here.

133
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:56,605
My father prayed to
the Many-Faced God.

134
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:00,943
And I drank the water
from his fountain.

135
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:04,013
It healed me.

<i>Her hopes and dreams,
her loves and hates?</i>

143

Forever?

145
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:33,656
No.

146
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:36,825
A girl is not ready
to become no one.

147
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,984
But she is ready to
become someone else.

Why Daenerys? Why
is she worth all this?

As I recall, the Mormonts
fought against the Targaryens

during Robert's Rebellion.

151
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:10,242
Do you believe in anything?

152
00:17:10,277 --> 00:17:11,944
I believe in lots of things.

00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,912
In something greater
than ourselves, I mean.

154

Do you believe there's
a plan for this world?

156
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:21,787
No.

157
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,088
Neither did I.

158
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:25,507
I was a cynic just like you.

159
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,677
Then I saw a girl
step into a great fire

00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:30,596
with three stone eggs.

161
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,432
When the fire burned out, I thought
I'd find her blackened bones.

162
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:37,553
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

163
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:41,607
alive and unhurt, holding
her baby dragons.

164

No.

00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,983
It's hard to be a
cynic after that.

167
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:55,154
Doesn't mean she's going
to be a great queen.

168
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:57,072
<i>No, it doesn't.</i>

169
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:59,408
The Targaryens are
famously insane.

170
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,328
What if she conquers
the world? Then what?

171
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:04,630
1,000 years of peace
and prosperity?

172
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:06,665
First we have to
conquer the world.

173
00:18:06,716 --> 00:18:08,584
We?

174
00:18:08,586 --> 00:18:10,803
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

175
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:14,173
<i>She's ecstatic when you
bring her this enemy dwarf.</i>

176
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:17,393
<i>She hacks off my head
and restores your position.</i>

177
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:19,728
You command her
army, sail to Westeros,

178
00:18:19,763 --> 00:18:22,681
defeat all your enemies and
watch her climb those steps

179
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:24,183
and sit on the Iron Throne.

180
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,485
Hurrah. Long live the
queen. Then what?

181
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,103
Then she rules.

182
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:31,323
So a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life

183
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:34,076
in Westeros becomes the ruler
of Westeros? That's justice?

184
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,662
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

185
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:40,532
Because her father, who burned living
men for amusement, was the king?

186
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,205
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

187
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:48,040
They probably
came ashore for--

Yeah, that or a galley slave.

<i>He looks strong enough.</i>

196
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:22,291
What about the dwarf?

197
00:19:22,325 --> 00:19:24,626
Worthless.

198
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:27,246
Cut his throat.

199
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:29,298
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait,
wait! Let's discuss this.

200
00:19:29,332 --> 00:19:31,750
And then chop off his cock.

201
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:33,001
We'll sell it for a fortune.

202
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,170
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

203

Wait! Wait!

Wait, wait, wait!

205
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:41,643
You can't just hand a
dry cock to a merchant

206
00:19:41,678 --> 00:19:43,178
and expect him to pay for it.

207
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
He has to know it
came from a dwarf.

208
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:48,534
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

209
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,319
It will be a
dwarf-sized cock.

210
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:52,354
Guess again.

211
00:19:57,193 --> 00:20:00,279
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

We're bound for Volantis,
not Slaver's Bay.

215
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:18,263
Besides, she reopened
the fighting pits.

216
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:20,966
I've never heard of free

You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

You are looking at one of the great
warriors in the Seven Kingdoms.

(LAUGHS)

221
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:33,479
Him.

222
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,449
Him? He's got to
be 60 years old.

223
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:40,202
Sure, he's a bit
long in the tooth,

224
00:20:40,236 --> 00:20:43,038
a bit withered, been
in the sun too long.

225
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:46,542
We can all see that. But he
is a veteran of 100 battles.

226
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:48,877
They wrote songs about him.

227
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:56,802
That true?

228
00:21:02,091 --> 00:21:04,977
He won the tournament
at Lannisport.

Jousting. You're
talking about jousting.

232
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:17,739
A fancy game for fancy lads.

233
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:20,526
The men who fight in the pits of
Meereen will swallow him whole.

234
00:21:20,577 --> 00:21:23,617
I killed a Dothraki
bloodrider in single combat.

235
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:35,541
Liar.

236
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:38,260
It's no lie. His
name was Qotho.

237
00:21:38,294 --> 00:21:41,179
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

238
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:45,183
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

We abandon our family names.

248

smashed the false idols,

Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

Do you think it's
wise, Your Grace,

arresting the heir
to Highgarden?

263
00:23:13,389 --> 00:23:16,224
The Faith arrested the
heir to Highgarden.

00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:19,387
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

The king's orders.

Is the king to blame for

House Tyrell won't

Ser Loras was promised to me.

00:23:32,308 --> 00:23:34,292
Instead he chose the
company of boys.

272
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:36,647
One's choice of companion
is a curious thing.

273
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:40,916
Most curious.

274
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,253
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

Thoroughly repellant woman.

Forgive me.

I know you're still in mourning.

Lysa was a good woman.

A kind woman.

Still, I pity her son.

How fortunate the

<i>has a new father to counsel him.</i>

284
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,111
I know how hard it can be

285
00:24:09,113 --> 00:24:11,947
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

286
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:14,949
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

287
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,370
Young Lord Robin
heeds my advice.

288
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:22,324
And I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

289
00:24:22,358 --> 00:24:24,159
Good.

If there's nothing else.

291
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,301
There is another
matter, Your Grace.

292
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:36,054
Something so urgent I couldn't
trust the words to a raven.

293
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:38,990
You once charged me
with finding Arya Stark.

294
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:41,943
To my shame, I failed you.

295
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:44,279
But I have found Sansa Stark.

296
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:49,201
Alive and well and home again

297
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,702
living at Winterfell.

298
00:24:50,737 --> 00:24:52,988
That's not possible.

299
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,373
My sources are well placed.

300
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,577
They tell me Roose Bolton

301
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:01,079
plans to marry her
to his son Ramsay,

302
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,799
a bastard recently
legitimized by King Tommen.

303
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:07,803
Roose Bolton is Warden of the
North by the grace of my father.

304
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:11,807
Indeed, his reward for stabbing
his own king in the heart.

305
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:15,227
We were fools to
trust a turncloak.

306
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,679
Marrying his son to
the last of the Starks

307
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:19,598
gives him more
legitimacy in the North

308
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,566
than an alliance with a
hated southern house.

309
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,986
I will skin him and his bastard

310
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:26,855
like that wretch on
their bloody sigil.

311
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:28,690
I would counsel
patience, Your Grace.

312
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:30,575
Patience?

313
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,160
Sansa helped murder my son.

314
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:33,745
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

315
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,747
Stannis Baratheon
is also a traitor,

316
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:37,399
marching with his
army on Winterfell.

317
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:39,918
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

318
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:42,587
Let the enemies of the
throne slaughter each other.

319
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:45,991
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

320
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:48,510
Winterfell is 1,000
miles away from here.

321
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,712
The weather has
already begun to turn.

322
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:53,648
That is why it is
critical to strike soon

323
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:56,101
while the victor still

Surely your Uncle Kevan
could muster a force.

the ice and the snow.

332
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,409
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

333
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,662
you have a reputation
as a moneylender

334
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:26,248
and a brothel keeper,
not a military man.

335
00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:28,433
You wouldn't risk a
single Lannister soldier

336
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:31,887
or a single coin from
the royal treasury.

337
00:26:31,921 --> 00:26:33,638
What do you have to lose?

338
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:35,540
A brothel keeper?

339
00:26:35,575 --> 00:26:37,092
And if you succeed?

340
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:39,261
Name me Warden of the North.

341
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:47,152
I'll speak to the
king this evening,

342
00:26:47,186 --> 00:26:49,354
have him issue a royal decree.

343
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,240
I'll not rest until the lion
flies over Winterfell.

344

And I'll know you're
a man of your word

345
00:26:54,594 --> 00:26:57,612

I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

349
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:13,678
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

350

We've waited long enough.

351

What is it?

354
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:26,358
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

355
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:28,276
Or do you--

356
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:38,320
We can't.
Not yet.

357
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:39,537
Why not?

358
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:41,623
You know why not.
Someone will see.

359
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,992
You are going to be my wife.

360
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:48,079
I am going to be your husband.

We're allowed to walk

walked through these gardens?

against Loras have merit,

482
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:25,806
which I'm sure they don't.

483
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,326
Loras will be freed, our
happy alliance will continue...

484
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:33,964
and we'll forget this unfortunate
conversation ever happened.

485
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,301
Good day, Lady Olenna.

<i>(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)</i>

487
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:59,707
You are aware of the rumors
concerning you and Renly?

488
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:03,410
I don't pay attention to rumors.

489
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:06,780
<i>You were said to be
despondent when he died.</i>

490
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:10,351
Witnesses state that you
refused to leave his bedside

491
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:12,920
even as Stannis's
army closed in.

492
00:37:12,971 --> 00:37:16,807
He was my friend.
He was my king.

493
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:19,259
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

494
00:37:19,311 --> 00:37:22,313
<i>He was anointed
by the Seven, not Renly.</i>

495
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:26,900
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

496
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:30,487
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

497
00:37:30,522 --> 00:37:32,990
I fought for him at the
Battle of Blackwater.

498
00:37:33,024 --> 00:37:36,694
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

499
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:39,079
Why does it matter what I wore?

500
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:41,749
Do you deny all the
charges against you?

501
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:43,834
Fornication.

502
00:37:43,868 --> 00:37:46,036
<i>Buggery.
Blasphemy.</i>

503
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,671
Of course I deny them.

504
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:49,757
You never lay with
Renly Baratheon?

505
00:37:49,791 --> 00:37:51,742
Never.

506
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:53,927
<i>Nor any other man?</i>

507
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:55,579
Never.

508
00:37:57,932 --> 00:38:00,551
That will be all, Ser Loras.

509
00:38:07,726 --> 00:38:10,444
Well, I think that's
quite enough of that.

510
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:13,063
The Faith calls Queen
Margaery forward.

511
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:15,065
You call me forward?

512

Yes, we have some

513

- I am the queen.
- You are.

514
00:38:21,623 --> 00:38:24,058
And according to the
law of the Seven,

515
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:26,493
neither kings nor
queens are exempt

516
00:38:26,544 --> 00:38:29,413
from testimony
at a holy inquest.

517
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:51,101
How do you respond to these
charges against your brother?

518
00:38:51,103 --> 00:38:52,870
They are lies.

519
00:38:52,904 --> 00:38:54,571

- All of them.

523
00:39:01,413 --> 00:39:03,280
of these charges against him

524

to the best of your knowledge?

525
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,034
Yes, I swear it.

00:39:08,286 --> 00:39:10,537
Thank you, Your Grace.

Yes, very well.

How did you come to meet?

531
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:49,493
OLYVAR: <i>I squired for him.</i>

532
00:39:49,527 --> 00:39:51,328
He took a liking to me.

533
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:54,540
He summoned me to his
chamber the first day we met.

534
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:59,336
And what occurred
in his chamber?

535
00:39:59,338 --> 00:40:03,841
We engaged in
intimate relations.

536
00:40:03,843 --> 00:40:05,676
You lay with him?

537
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:07,261
That night and many others.

538
00:40:07,312 --> 00:40:09,763
Liar. He's
a liar.

539
00:40:11,316 --> 00:40:13,183
Is there anyone else who
can support your claim?

540
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:15,486
Yes.

541
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,405
Yes, Queen Margaery.

<i>She walked in on us once

She didn't seem surprised.

544
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:28,499
This testimony is an
insult to a great house.

545
00:40:28,533 --> 00:40:31,702
Why should the Faith or anyone
else take the word of a squire

546
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,370
over the heir to Highgarden?

547
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:35,422
OLYVAR: <i>He has a

What are you
doing? Let us pass.

553
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:52,222
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

554
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:54,191

What do you want?

571
00:41:48,913 --> 00:41:51,748
Lord Ramsay sent me to
draw you a bath, my lady.

572
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:54,518
You want to be clean and fresh

00:41:54,552 --> 00:41:56,592
for your new husband, don't you?

574
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:15,806
You're so beautiful,

but you need to keep him happy.

576
00:42:18,893 --> 00:42:23,146
Ramsay gets bored easily.

577
00:42:23,197 --> 00:42:25,315
You don't want
to end up like--

578
00:42:27,285 --> 00:42:29,903
well, like the others.

579
00:42:29,954 --> 00:42:32,289
What others?

580
00:42:32,323 --> 00:42:34,574
MYRANDA: I
shouldn't gossip.

581
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:37,210
Oh, it's good to
see the red again.

582

No point hiding anymore.

583
00:42:39,297 --> 00:42:40,747
What others?

584
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:43,383
Let's see, there was Kyra

585
00:42:43,418 --> 00:42:45,385
the blacksmith's daughter.

586
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,005
She was tall like
you, lovely figure.

587
00:42:48,056 --> 00:42:52,509
But she talked and
talked and talked

588
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,929
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

589
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,482
Then there was Violet.

590
00:42:58,516 --> 00:43:01,018
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

591
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:04,021
But she got pregnant.

592
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:06,940
And, well, that was boring.

593
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:10,661
Then Tansy.

594
00:43:10,695 --> 00:43:12,329
Such a sweet girl.

Of course, sweet

597
00:43:19,704 --> 00:43:22,005
Ramsay let me come
with him on that hunt.

598
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,173
Hunt?

599
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:25,042
Mmm.

00:43:27,095 --> 00:43:31,381
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

601
00:43:31,432 --> 00:43:33,300
Not so pretty.

602
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:38,438
But, well, it's your
wedding day.

603
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:40,973
Why am I talking
about such things?

604
00:43:43,277 --> 00:43:45,062
What was your name again?

And how long have yo
loved him, Myranda?

607

Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

608

If you please, my lady,

No.

617
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,735
Lord Ramsay, he said
I'm to take your arm.

618
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:17,287
I'm not touching you.

He'll punish me.

You think I care
what he does to you?

622

Who comes before the
old gods this night?

A woman grown,

She comes to beg the
blessings of the gods.

Lord-- Lord Tyrion was kind.

643
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:36,846
He was gentle. He
never touched me.

644
00:49:38,482 --> 00:49:39,833
You're not lying to me?

645
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,668
No, my lord.

646
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:44,437
Lying to your husband
on his wedding night,

647
00:49:44,472 --> 00:49:47,974
that would be a bad
way to start a marriage.

648
00:49:52,897 --> 00:49:56,015
We're man and wife now.

649
00:49:56,067 --> 00:49:58,101
We should be honest
with each other.

650
00:49:58,235 --> 00:49:59,936
Don't you think?

651
00:50:00,938 --> 00:50:02,856
Yes.

652
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:14,701
Good.

653
00:50:16,954 --> 00:50:18,788
Take off your clothes.

654
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,794
Oh, no, no, no.

655
00:50:24,879 --> 00:50:27,847
You stay here, Reek.

656
00:50:27,882 --> 00:50:30,133
You watch.

657
00:50:42,196 --> 00:50:45,215
Do I need to ask a second time?

658
00:50:45,282 --> 00:50:47,484
I hate asking a second time.

659
00:51:15,429 --> 00:51:16,646
Reek...

660
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,883
I told you to watch.

661
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:28,691
You've known Sansa
since she was a girl.

662
00:51:29,994 --> 00:51:31,612
Now watch her become a woman.

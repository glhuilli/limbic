2
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,328
<i>- Look out!</i>
<i>- Fire! Fire!</i>

3
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,556
A band of 20
men, maybe less.

4
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,808
They were in and out
before anyone spotted them.

5
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,777
Burnt our food stores
to the ground,

6
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,029
all our siege weapons destroyed.

7
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,398
- Dozens of tents were--
- Horses?

8
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:13,567
We're still getting a count,
but hundreds are dead.

9
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:17,288
20 men rode into our camp without a
single guard sounding the alarm?

10
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,823
The northerners know more about
their land than we ever will.

11
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:21,492
Put last night's guards
in chains.

12
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:23,210
Either they fell asleep or
they conspired with the enemy.

13
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,830
- Find out the truth and then hang them.
- Your Grace.

14
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,084
Unless there's a thaw, we can't
press forward to Winterfell

15
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,720
and we don't have enough food
to get us back to Castle Black.

16
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,588
We're not returning
to Castle Black.

17
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,008
Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed
to be an expert in military matters,

18
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:41,645
but if we can't march forward
and we won't march back...

19
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,528
Have the dead horses
butchered for meat.

20
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,404
<i>Halt!</i>

21
00:04:40,455 --> 00:04:43,374
<i> Halt!</i>

22
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,579
<i> There it is!</i>

23
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,421
Open the gates.

24
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,422
It was a failure.

25
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,225
It wasn't.

26
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:53,477
I went to save them.
I failed.

27
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,314
You didn't fail him.

28
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:58,699
Or him.

29
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,535
<i>Or her.</i>

30
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:05,038
Every one of them is alive
because of you and no one else.

31
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,992
I don't think that
fact's lost on them.

32
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:06,350
You have a good heart, Jon Snow.

33
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,852
It'll get us all killed.

34
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,810
Out of my way.

35
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,421
You sent for me, Your Grace?

36
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:46,723
Find some healthy horses and
a few knights to guard you.

37
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,759
I'm sending you back
to Castle Black.

38
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,011
Tell the Lord Commander
his king commands him

39
00:07:51,062 --> 00:07:53,430
to send food, supplies,
fresh horses.

40
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:55,232
In return,
when I take the throne,

41
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,268
I'll make sure the Night's Watch
has all the men it requires.

42
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,605
He can guard all 19 castles
on the Wall if he so wishes.

43
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:06,910
Your Grace,
you named me your Hand.

44
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,512
Yes.

45
00:08:08,546 --> 00:08:10,497
The King's Hand should
never abandon the king,

46
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,949
especially in time of war.

47
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:13,800
You're not abandoning me.
You're obeying a command.

48
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:16,253
A boy with a scroll
could deliver this message.

49
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,839
And if Jon Snow refuses
the boy with the scroll,

50
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,091
what does the boy say?

51
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,293
I didn't name you Hand for your
expertise in military matters.

52
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,796
Ride for Castle Black.
Don't come back empty-handed.

53
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,605
Your Grace, perhaps Queen Selyse

54
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,523
and Princess Shireen
could accompany me.

55
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,609
My family stays with me.

56
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,644
At least let me take Shireen.

57
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:43,230
<i>A siege is no place</i>
<i>for a little girl.</i>

58
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,649
My family stays with me.

59
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:23,070
What's this one now?

60
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,439
"The Dance of Dragons:
A True Telling"

61
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,907
by Grand Maester Munkun.

62
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,277
Now that sounds
like a proper story.

63
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:32,946
Ser Byron Swann wanted
to kill the dragon Vhagar.

64
00:09:32,997 --> 00:09:35,949
He polished his shield for a week
so that it was like a mirror.

65
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,035
And he crouched behind it
and crept forward,

66
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,087
hoping the dragon would
only see its own reflection.

67
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,206
But the dragon saw a dumb man
holding a mirrored shield.

68
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,925
And burnt him to a crisp.

69
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:48,545
Thus ending
the dragon-slaying career

70
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,381
of Ser Byron Swann.

71
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,019
I made you something, Princess.

72
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,894
Do you like it?

73
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,812
He's beautiful.

74
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:08,565
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

75
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,118
Will you make me a doe, too?
So that he can have company?

76
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,986
Of course I will.

77
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:16,073
But why am I getting a present?

78
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,159
Because you deserve it.

79
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:24,331
My son was always on me,
trying to teach me to read.

80
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:26,717
Gods, I was stubborn about it.

81
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:29,669
Made it this far
without reading.

82
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:32,222
Seemed to me I could
make it to the grave.

83
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:36,426
Wish I'd listened to him.

84
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,263
This is my own poor way
of saying thank you.

85
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,069
For teaching me
to be a grown-up.

86
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,525
I'll be gone for a
few days, Princess.

87
00:10:51,576 --> 00:10:54,244
I want to hear all about "The
Dance of Dragons" when I'm back.

88
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,530
You'll read it yourself.

89
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,469
Prince Doran.

90
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,105
Forgive us.
We started without you.

91
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,858
<i>Please, sit.</i>

92
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:27,394
Princess Myrcella.

93
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,062
Uncle.

94
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,947
What a lovely dress.

95
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,283
- You don't like it?
- You must be cold.

96
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,953
Not at all. The Dornish
climate agrees with me.

97
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:40,824
Prince Trystane.

98
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,161
How's your jaw?

99
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,997
A fleabite.

100
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:48,632
What are you doing in Dorne?

101
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,934
Looking after the safety of my
niece, the Princess Myrcella.

102
00:11:50,968 --> 00:11:54,304
And rather than send a raven
or speak to me directly,

103
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,673
you decided to enter
my country in secret

104
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,341
and abduct our guest by force?

105
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,595
We received
a threatening message.

106
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:04,848
The princess's necklace
in the jaws of a viper.

107
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,185
That necklace
was stolen from my room.

108
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:16,943
Oh, excellent.

109
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:19,196
A last meal before
the beheading?

110
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,780
Oh, I can't behead you.

111
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:23,250
Many in Dorne want war.

112
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,268
But I've seen war.

113
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,038
I've seen the bodies
piled on the battlefields.

114
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,558
I've seen the orphans
starving in the cities.

115
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,677
I don't want to lead
my people into that hell.

116
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,379
No, you want to break bread
with the Lannisters.

117
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,049
And that is precisely
what we are doing.

118
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,471
Let us drink to Tommen,
the First of His Name,

119
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:47,007
<i>King of the Andals</i>
<i>and the First Men,</i>

120
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,226
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

121
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,079
King Tommen insists

122
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,082
on his sister's return
to the capital?

123
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,251
I'm afraid he does.

124
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,389
I cannot disobey
my king's command.

125
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,892
She will return with you
to King's Landing.

126
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:25,345
<i>And my son Prince Trystane</i>
<i>will accompany you both.</i>

127
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,015
If the alliance between the Iron
Throne and Dorne is to continue,

128
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,517
their engagement must stand.

129
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:32,652
I accept.

130
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,355
One more thing.
My brother was named

131
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:38,074
to the small council
before his death.

132
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,026
Your father understood
the importance

133
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,895
<i>of keeping Dorne in the fold.</i>

134
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:46,499
With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take
his place on the small council.

135
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:47,684
You have my word.

136
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:50,203
The word of a kingslayer.

137
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:56,760
No wonder you can't stand.
You have no spine.

138
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,045
You are mother
to four of my nieces,

139
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,847
girls I love very much.

140
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,683
For their sake, I hope you
live a long and happy life.

141
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,219
Speak to me that way
again, and you won't.

142
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,697
May I inquire as to the
fate of my man Bronn?

143
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,817
Tell me, Ser Jaime,
in King's Landing,

144
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:24,154
how do they punish a commoner
who strikes a prince?

145
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:25,755
He said it was just a fleabite.

146
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,909
The fault is mine.

147
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:32,195
Bronn is merely a soldier
following my orders.

148
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:35,799
If anyone should
be punished, it's me.

149
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,668
Prince Trystane must learn
judgment if he is to rule one day.

150
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,470
I'll let him decide.

151
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,894
I have learned the value
of mercy from my father.

152
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,331
- <i> I'll set your man free.</i>
- You're a good man.

153
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:54,217
On one condition.

154
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,277
Why do we play?
I'm better than you.

155
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:06,663
I'll always be better than you.

156
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,532
Have I ever missed once?

157
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,452
I don't think I have.
I can't recall.

158
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:15,088
You must love humiliation.
Or pain.

159
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,792
Which do you love most,
humiliation or pain?

160
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,761
That one hurt, didn't it?

161
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,764
You going to cry?

162
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,716
Give up, little sister.

163
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,802
- You're going to miss.
- Oh, I never miss.

164
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:32,138
You will.
You're thinking too much.

165
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:35,225
Now you're nervous.
What if she's right?

166
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,448
- Luck.
- Now it's my turn.

167
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,116
You're too slow.

168
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,984
You've always been too slow.

169
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,586
Am I gonna be happy
at the end of this walk?

170
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,672
You'll find out very soon.

171
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,427
Say it one more time, handsome.

172
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,895
Who am I?

173
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,815
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

174
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,233
And that's the truth.

175
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,903
Slut.

176
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,905
Prince Doran,

177
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,941
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

178
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:27,360
I didn't realize there were
knights of the Blackwater.

179
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,995
Only the one.

180
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,581
I believe you've already
met Prince Trystane.

181
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,783
Prince.

182
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,585
Sorry about the other day.

183
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,088
<i>Prince Trystane
here is a man of mercy.</i>

184
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,457
He's agreed to grant
you your freedom.

185
00:16:42,093 --> 00:16:44,127
I'm glad to hear it.

186
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,963
Pie looks good.

187
00:16:47,014 --> 00:16:49,632
There was one condition.

188
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,060
Perhaps some soup instead.

189
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,449
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

190
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:11,404
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

191
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:15,291
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

192
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,494
Oysters, clams,
and cock--

193
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:19,212
How much for your little clam?

194
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,723
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

195
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,646
Oysters, clams, and cockles.

196
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,543
Come on.

197
00:18:08,596 --> 00:18:11,598
<i>Some oysters, girl!</i>

198
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,300
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

199
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,686
Is, uh...

200
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:20,023
- Girl!
<i>-  Tie her up!</i>

201
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,443
<i>Are you deaf? Girl!</i>

202
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,446
Girl!

203
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:33,236
My lord.

204
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,875
<i>My lord.</i>

205
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,660
<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>

206
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,245
On behalf of the Iron Bank,

207
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,214
may I be the first
to welcome you

208
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,965
to the Free City of Braavos.

209
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,967
I hope your journey
was trouble-free.

210
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,719
A bit of chop the last few days.

211
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,838
Nothing too awful.

212
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:54,307
Good to see the old chap
still guarding the harbor.

213
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,643
And how goes the
harvest in the Reach?

214
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,062
Ah, the vintners say
this might be

215
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,265
the best year for red
grapes in half a century.

216
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:05,401
<i>If we come to a
satisfactory arrangement,</i>

217
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:10,273
I'll be sure to send a cask of
the Arbor's finest your way.

218
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,942
I'm afraid I don't partake.

219
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,994
Oh.

220
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:24,704
Some consider usury
distasteful, dishonorable.

221
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:26,372
Pure nonsense, of course.

222
00:19:26,423 --> 00:19:28,708
I'm glad we see eye to
eye on this matter.

223
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:31,127
<i>Did you know that at
one point Maegor the third</i>

224
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:34,013
tried to outlaw it
in the Seven Kingdoms?

225
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,182
Wanted to arrest anyone
caught charging interest

226
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,885
<i>and cut off both their hands.</i>

227
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:41,020
Most unfortunate
for the glovers.

228
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,189
<i>If a man charges
no interest on a loan,</i>

229
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,341
<i>then he has nothing to gain</i>
<i>and everything to lose,</i>

230
00:19:45,376 --> 00:19:46,809
<i>so why chance it?</i>

231
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,611
<i>Whereas the promise of reward</i>

232
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,197
<i>makes a man willing to gamble.</i>

233
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,651
We are not gamblers here at
the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell.

234
00:19:54,702 --> 00:19:57,120
You are the world's
best gamblers.

235
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,990
And all those bets
you won built this.

236
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,586
We should celebrate.

237
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:16,139
I'm afraid I still have
a good deal of work to do.

238
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,257
<i>Oh, nonsense. Work's over.
Do you sing?</i>

239
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,009
- I don't have that gift.
- Oh, it's not a gift.

240
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,177
It's a skill.
Anyone can learn it.

241
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:25,765
♪ So give me a kiss
by the Long Canal ♪

242

245
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:40,580
<i>Thought that old shit
would never stop singing.</i>

246
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,582
Wasn't bad, though.

247
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,201
The Tyrells can all rot in hell.

248
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:46,919
Treasonous cunts.

249
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,839
They were going to make
that boy-fucker Renly king.

250
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,792
This is the place, lads.

251
00:20:52,843 --> 00:20:55,261
The sleekest little minks
in Braavos.

252
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,181
- You buying?
- Oh, I'm buying.

253
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,383
But I never was good at sharing.

254
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,573
Sell your fish somewhere else.

255
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,459
Oh, let her in, Brusco.
I'm hungry.

256
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,411
Come here, sweetness.

257
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:35,418
They say oysters
get the juices flowing.

258
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,670
We'll take half a dozen.

259
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,340
Three coppers.

260
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:44,761
Here's a silver because
the lady likes you.

261
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,872
Too old.

262
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,627
Brea.

263
00:22:32,793 --> 00:22:34,360
Too old.

264
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,899
<i>I have just the one.
Anara.</i>

265
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:43,319
<i>Our most expensive girl.</i>

266
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:47,540
<i>But well worth it, I assure you.</i>

267
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:54,347
Too old.

268
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:04,040
Do you have what I want or not?

269
00:23:04,074 --> 00:23:07,927
Of course.
Of course.

270
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,351
These fresh?

271
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,991
Come on, the lads are hungry.

272
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,782
Nothing better for your
cockstand than fresh oysters.

273
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,873
<i>- Here. Thank you.</i>
<i>- I'll have one.</i>

274
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,904
<i>Any vinegar?</i>

275
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,191
Who let this girl in?
Shoo! Shoo!

276
00:23:58,612 --> 00:24:00,730
Good.

277
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,908
I'll tell you when we're done.

278
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,582
You'll have a fresh one
for me tomorrow?

279
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:21,968
Of course.

280
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,174
<i>I'll have
you whipped, girl.</i>

281
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:30,593
Go, go on.
Out, out, go.

282
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,357
Valar morghulis.

283
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,442
Valar morghulis.

284
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,292
And?

285
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,045
The thin man
wasn't hungry today.

286
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,180
Perhaps that is why
a man is thin.

287
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,966
Tomorrow.

288
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,135
Tomorrow.

289
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,255
A girl has work to do.

290
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:33,105
Your rebellion is over.

291
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,941
You can swear your
allegiance to me now...

292
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,328
or you can die.

293
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,832
I believe in second chances.

294
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,537
I don't believe
in third chances.

295
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:51,901
You write like
a seven-year-old.

296
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,738
Your maester kindly agreed
to copy it over for me.

297
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:57,289
<i>He didn't try to make you pay?</i>

298
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,041
Mm-mmm.

299
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:01,210
Maybe he's changed.

300
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,497
The queen will be thrilled to know
you're bringing her daughter home.

301
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,798
She will.

302
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,250
You love her very much,
don't you?

303
00:27:08,301 --> 00:27:10,803
Of course, she's my niece.

304
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,755
I wasn't talking about her.

305
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:16,759
You think I disapprove?

306
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,427
Why?

307
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,430
Because people disapprove of that
sort of thing where you are from?

308
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:24,650
They disapproved of Oberyn
and me where you are from.

309
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,404
Here no one blinked an eye.

310
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,906
100 years ago,

311
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,609
no one would have
blinked an eye at you

312
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,444
if you'd been named Targaryen.

313
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:41,417
It's always changing, who we're
supposed to love and who we're not.

314
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,787
The only thing
that stays the same

315
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,656
is that we want who we want.

316
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,769
I know your daughter had no
part in the terrible thing

317
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,937
that happened to the man I love.

318
00:28:04,624 --> 00:28:07,109
Perhaps even you
are innocent of that.

319
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:27,546
Father.

320
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,334
Aren't you cold?

321
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,755
No. What are you reading?

322
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:40,392
- "The Dance of Dragons."
- What's it about?

323
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,912
It's the story of the fight
between Rhaenyra Targaryen

324
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:46,232
and her half-brother Aegon for
control over the Seven Kingdoms.

325
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,068
Both of them thought they
belonged on the Iron Throne.

326
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:52,354
When people started declaring
for one of them or the other,

327
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:54,657
their fight divided
the kingdoms in two.

328
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,077
Brothers fought brothers,
dragons fought dragons.

329
00:28:59,746 --> 00:29:03,699
By the time it was over,
thousands were dead.

330
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,702
And it was a disaster
for the Targaryens as well.

331
00:29:06,753 --> 00:29:09,505
They never truly recovered.

332
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,540
"The Dance of Dragons."

333
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,344
Why is that a dance?

334
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,846
It's just what they call it.

335
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,048
Hmm, doesn't make much sense.

336
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,050
I think it's poetic.

337
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,442
If you had to choose

338
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,812
between Rhaenyra and Aegon...

339
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,899
who would you have chosen?

340
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,485
I wouldn't have chosen either.

341
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:42,705
It's all the choosing sides that
made everything so horrible.

342
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,040
Sometimes a person
has to choose.

343
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,379
Sometimes the world
forces his hand.

344
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:55,251
If a man knows what he is...

345
00:29:56,636 --> 00:29:59,471
and remains true to himself...

346
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,144
the choice is no choice at all.

347
00:30:05,228 --> 00:30:08,264
He must fulfill his destiny...

348
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:13,936
and become
who he is meant to be.

349
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:18,490
However much he may hate it.

350
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:22,611
It's all right, Father.

351
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:25,497
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

352
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,283
It doesn't matter.

353
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:29,585
I want to help you.

354
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,287
Is there any way I can help?

355
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,546
Yes, there is.

356
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,431
Good. I want to.

357
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:47,469
I'm the Princess Shireen
of House Baratheon.

358
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,772
And I'm your daughter.

359
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:05,988
Forgive me.

360
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,498
Where's my father?
I want to see my father.

361
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:52,668
It will all be over
soon, Princess.

362
00:31:56,639 --> 00:31:58,090
No.

363
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,928
Where's my father?

364
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,447
No, you can't do this.
Father, where are you?

365
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,933
<i>Please, let me see my father.</i>

366
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,803
<i>Father, where are you?</i>
<i>Don't let her do this.</i>

367
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:14,523
Please let go!

368
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,860
<i>Let me see my father!</i>
<i>Where are you? Please!</i>

369
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,229
- It's what the Lord wants.
- No.

370
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,315
- <i> Please! Let go! No!</i>
- It's a good thing.

371
00:32:23,366 --> 00:32:25,484
- A great thing.
<i>-  Stop. Stop!</i>

372
00:32:25,535 --> 00:32:27,403
<i>- Please!</i>
<i>- Hear us now, my Lord.</i>

373
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:30,205
<i>- You can't do this!</i>
<i>- For you, we offer up this girl</i>

374
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,042
- Please!
-<i>...that you may cleanse her with your fire</i>

375
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,044
and that its light
may lead our way.

376
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,079
<i> Please! No, please
let me see my father.</i>

377
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,298
If we don't act,
we'll all starve here.

378
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,300
<i> All of us.</i>

379
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,001
But if we make this sacrifice...

380
00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,254
<i>Accept this token
of our faith, my Lord,</i>

381
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:48,140
and lead us from the darkness.

382
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:51,143
- Lord of Light, show us the way.
- Mother!

383
00:32:51,227 --> 00:32:53,312
Mother, please!

384
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,765
Mother, please!
Mother!

385
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:58,901
- <i> Mother!</i>
- We can't.

386
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,936
- There's no other way. She has king's blood.
-<i> Please don't do this!</i>

387
00:33:00,938 --> 00:33:02,938
<i>Lord of
Light, protect us.</i>

388
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:06,942
- Please! Father, please!
-<i> For the night is dark and full of terrors.</i>

389
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,660
Father!

390
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,696
Father, don't do this!
Please!

391
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:14,116
Mother, no! Please!
Please, help!

392
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:16,452
Don't do this!

393
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,171
Please, Father!
Mother, help!

394
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,541
- No.
-<i> No, please! Don't do this!</i>

395
00:33:22,592 --> 00:33:25,878
<i>Don't do this, please, Mother!</i>

396
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:29,798
<i>Please, Mother!</i>
<i>Mother, help!</i>

397
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,851
Mother, help!
Help!

398
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,020
<i>Please don't do this, Mother!</i>

399
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,472
<i>Please!</i>

400
00:33:36,523 --> 00:33:38,724
<i>Please, Mother!</i>
<i>Please!</i>

401
00:33:38,775 --> 00:33:40,859
<i>Please! No!</i>

402
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:44,730
<i>Please! No!</i>

403
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,883
No!

404
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,051
Where have you been?

405
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,220
Just making sure
everything is in order.

406
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:22,578
_

407
00:35:22,822 --> 00:35:25,950
_

408
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:28,567
_

409
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:30,355
_

410
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:33,800
_

411
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,480
They're waiting for you.

412
00:36:31,482 --> 00:36:33,482
Clap your hands.

413
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,513
That one, the smaller man.

414
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:06,348
No question, that's where
you should put your money.

415
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,766
The smaller man it is.

416
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:09,685
I'm not putting
my money anywhere.

417
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:11,853
Kings and queens
never bet on the games.

418
00:37:11,904 --> 00:37:14,189
Perhaps you should go
find someone who does.

419
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,159
People used to bet against me
when I fought in the pits.

420
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,195
He would have bet against me.
Common novice mistake.

421
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:22,280
I've spent much
of my life in this arena.

422
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:24,333
And in my experience,
large men do triumph

423
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,668
over smaller men
far more often than not.

424
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,588
Has your experience ever
involved any actual fighting?

425
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,256
You yourself?

426
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,209
Have you ever tried to kill another
man who was trying to kill you?

427
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:39,131
Whenever I got into the pit
against a beast like that one,

428
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:41,850
the crowd saw me, all
skin and bone back then,

429
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:45,187
then they saw a pile of angry
muscles ready to murder me.

430
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,389
They couldn't get their
money out fast enough.

431
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,892
But the pile of angry muscles
never had any muscles here

432
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:54,312
or... here.

433
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:56,064
And the big men
were always too slow

434
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:58,984
to stop my dagger from going
where their muscles weren't.

435
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:02,871
Yes, whenever I saw a beast like
that one standing across from me

436
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,992
making his beast faces,
I knew I could rest easy.

437
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,839
You don't approve?

438
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,759
There's always been more than enough
death in the world for my taste.

439
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,761
I can do without it
in my leisure time.

440
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:28,263
Fair enough. Yet it's
an unpleasant question,

441
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:32,684
but what great thing has ever been
accomplished without killing or cruelty?

442
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:36,021
It's easy to confuse what is
with what ought to be,

443
00:38:36,072 --> 00:38:38,824
especially when what is
has worked out in your favor.

444
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,358
I'm not talking about myself.

445
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,028
I'm talking about the necessary
conditions for greatness.

446
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,996
That is greatness?

447
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,950
That is a vital part of the
great city of Meereen,

448
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:51,453
which existed
long before you or I

449
00:38:51,504 --> 00:38:55,590
and will remain standing long after
we have returned to the dirt.

450
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,626
My father would have liked you.

451
00:39:06,185 --> 00:39:09,938
_

452
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,274
One day your great city will
return to the dirt as well.

453
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,559
- At your command?
- If need be.

454
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:15,908
_

455
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:23,151
And how many people will die
to make this happen?

456
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:26,571
If it comes to that, they will
have died for a good reason.

457
00:39:26,622 --> 00:39:28,707
Those men think they're
dying for a good reason.

458
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,492
Someone else's reason.

459
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:32,878
So your reasons are true
and theirs are false?

460
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,797
They don't know their
own minds, but you do?

461
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,834
Well said.
You're an eloquent man.

462
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:40,552
Doesn't mean you're wrong.

463
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,754
In my experience,
eloquent men are right

464
00:39:42,805 --> 00:39:44,556
every bit as often as imbeciles.

465
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,403
_

466
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:50,562
_

467
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,937
_

468
00:40:12,124 --> 00:40:14,503
- Your Grace--
- Shut your mouth.

469
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,068
- You can end this.
- She cannot.

470
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,654
You can.

471
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,703
Protect your queen!

472
00:44:36,265 --> 00:44:38,016
Go!

473
00:45:02,124 --> 00:45:04,125
Your Grace!
Your Grace!

474
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,376
<i>Come with me.</i>
<i>I know a way out.</i>

475
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,828
I know a way--

476
00:45:42,665 --> 00:45:43,781
Stay close.

477
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,757

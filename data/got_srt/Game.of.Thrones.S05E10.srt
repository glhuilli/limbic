Man:
<i>Brace the wind.</i>

5
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:13,719
The Lord of Light has made
good on his promise, my king.

6
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,555
His fires have melted
the snows away.

7
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:18,140
The way ahead is clear.

8
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,775
We ride for Winterfell.

9
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,226
And you will take it.

10
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:26,231
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

11
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:28,901
You will receive
what is yours by right.

12
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:51,673
Your Grace.

13
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:53,225
Prepare to form up.

14
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:55,010
Your Grace.

15
00:02:58,348 --> 00:02:59,648
Tell me.

16
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:03,352
The men, many deserted
before dawn.

17
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:07,523
Stannis:
<i>How many?</i>

18
00:03:07,607 --> 00:03:09,608
General:
<i>Nearly half.</i>

19
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,528
All the sellswords
with all the horses.

20
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:25,424
Your Grace.

21
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:30,796
Speak up. Can't be
worse than mutiny.

22
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:03,245
Cut her down.

23
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:18,260
General:
<i>Your Grace.</i>

24
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:21,263
The Lady Melisandre was just
seen riding out of camp.

25
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:35,611
Get the men
into marching formation.

26
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,615
On to Winterfell.

27
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:44,086
- <i> (distant horse neighs)</i>
- <i> (wind howling)</i>

28
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,256
He raised his hands

29
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,591
and they all stood up at once.

30
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:55,948
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

31
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:57,633
So what are you gonna do?

32
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,689
I'm gonna hope they don't
learn how to climb the Wall.

33
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,475
But the dragonglass...

34
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,311
No one's ever
getting that back now.

35
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:11,964
<i>It wouldn't have</i>
<i>mattered anyway.</i>

36
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:13,448
<i>Not unless we had</i>
<i>a mountain of it.</i>

37
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,118
But you killed a white walker.

38
00:05:16,152 --> 00:05:17,753
<i>With Longclaw.</i>

39
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:21,490
I saw them shatter steel
axes like they were glass.

40
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,493
- But Longclaw...
- Sam:<i> Is Valyrian steel.</i>

41
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:27,112
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

42
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:28,964
Not enough.

43
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,001
The first Lord Commander
in history

44
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:35,470
to sacrifice the lives
of sworn brothers

45
00:05:35,505 --> 00:05:37,589
to save the lives of wildlings.

46
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:44,229
How's it feel to be friends with the
most hated man in Castle Black?

47
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,315
<i>You were friends with me</i>
<i>when I first came here.</i>

48
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:48,433
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

49
00:05:48,484 --> 00:05:51,520
Here's to us, then.

50
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:53,238
Long may they sneer.

51
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:03,448
What?

52
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:07,636
I wanted to ask you something.

53
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,206
To ask something of you.

54
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:17,012
Send me, Gilly,
and the baby to Oldtown

55
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:19,214
so I can become a maester.

56
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:22,017
That's what I'm meant to be.
Not this.

57
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:25,270
I need you here, Sam.

58
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:27,723
If you leave, who's left
to give me advice I trust?

59
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:31,193
Well, there's Edd.

60
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,531
I'd be more use
to you as a maester.

61
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:40,535
More use to everyone now
that Maester Aemon is gone.

62
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,372
The Citadel has the
world's greatest library.

63
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:46,575
I'll learn about history,

64
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:49,111
strategy, healing.

65
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:50,812
And other things,

66
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,749
things that will
help when--

67
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,417
when they come.

68
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:01,123
If Gilly stays here,
then she'll die.

69
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:05,961
And the baby that she
named after me will die.

70
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:09,231
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

71
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:14,186
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

72
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,189
will be the look in her
eyes when I fail them.

73
00:07:21,944 --> 00:07:25,113
And I'd rather see a thousand
white walkers than see that.

74
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:36,258
(sighs)

75
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,680
Thank you.

76
00:07:43,216 --> 00:07:45,350
You know that the Citadel will
make you swear off women, too.

77
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,636
Oh, they'll bloody try.

78
00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:53,742
- Sam.
- What?

79
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:57,345
Sam.

80
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:01,149
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you--

81
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,819
Oh, very carefully.

82
00:08:05,688 --> 00:08:06,955
I'm glad the end of the world's

83
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,723
working out well for someone.

84
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,597
I'll come back.

85
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:19,050
To your return.

86
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:21,720
To my return.

87
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:48,590
(clicks)

88
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:03,605
Man:
<i>Aye, this way.</i>

89
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,091
<i>(distant men shouting)</i>

90

Podrick:
<i>My lady!</i>

91
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,395
Stannis.

92
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,564
Stannis Baratheon is coming.
His whole army.

93
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:47,032
How do you know it's Stannis?

94
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:48,984
They're carrying his
flaming heart banners.

95
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:52,571
From the Blackwater.
I'll never forget it.

96
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,181
(grunts)

97
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,443
Trench here.

98
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:33,695
Another one 300 yards
from the castle wall.

99
00:11:33,697 --> 00:11:35,914
Hurry them along.

100
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:37,449
- Right, Curlew.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,700
<i>Dig between those two rises.</i>

102
00:11:38,702 --> 00:11:40,635
- Spread out.
- Soldier:<i> I'm with you.</i>

103
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,871
- Soldier #2:<i> Archers!</i>
- Soldier #3:<i> Spread out!</i>

104
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:45,507
And send out a foraging
party immediately.

105
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,842
Siege begins at sunrise.

106
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:50,295
There's not going to be
a siege, Your Grace.

<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

Bolton has women
fighting for him?

122
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:45,286
I don't fight for the Boltons.

123
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,656
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

124
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,595
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

125
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:03,438
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

126
00:15:06,275 --> 00:15:09,644
<i>You murdered him</i>
<i>with blood magic?</i>

127
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,951
I did.

128
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,396
In the name of Renly
of House Baratheon,

129
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,131
First of His Name,

130
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:33,151
rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

131
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:36,437
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

132
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:40,542
I, Brienne of Tarth,
sentence you to die.

133
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,950
Do you have any last words?

134
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:00,295
Go on, do your duty.

135
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,448
Looks like we're done here.

136

<i>(soldier groaning)</i>

Let's head back.

141
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,352
My wife must be lonely.

My lady.

146
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:34,439
I've come to escort you
back to your chamber.

147
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:37,025
Go with her, please.

148
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,731
I know what Ramsay is.

149
00:17:43,782 --> 00:17:45,984
I know what he'll do to me.

150
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:51,239
If I'm going to die,

151
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,792
let it happen while there's
still some of me left.

152
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:58,496
Die?

153
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:00,982
Who said anything about dying?

154
00:18:01,016 --> 00:18:02,684
You can't die.

155
00:18:02,718 --> 00:18:04,452
Your father was
Warden of the North.

156
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:06,421
Ramsay needs you.

157
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:11,893
Though I suppose he
doesn't need all of you.

158
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,595
Just the parts he'll use
to make his heir,

159
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:17,765
until you've given him a boy or
two and he's finished using them.

160
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:24,405
Then he's got incredible
plans for those parts.

161
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:27,608
So, shall we wait
for him to come back

162
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,610

The wrong life.

205

That man's life
was not yours to take.

A girl stole from
the Many-Faced God.

Why are you crying?

218
00:24:32,074 --> 00:24:33,774
He was my friend.

219

No, he wasn't.
Didn't you listen to him?

You are still someone.

And to someone,

228
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,179
the faces are as good as poison.

Got a noblewoman
to marry back home.

but I'm glad you're coming home.

Your mother's desperate
to see you.

I'm glad Trystane

You're lucky.

Arranged marriages

so well arranged.

Do you think Mother
will like him?

If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.

You really believe that?

259
00:27:27,198 --> 00:27:29,984
Have you ever known
your mother to like anyone

260

aside from her children?

261
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,154
She likes you.

262
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:37,074
I'm not so sure about that.

263

Listen...

264
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:42,963
there's something
I wanted to tell you.

265
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:47,468
Something I should
have told you long ago.

266
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:49,336
So...

267
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,224
now that you've seen
more of the world,

268
00:27:54,259 --> 00:27:57,928
you've learned how
complicated things can be,

269
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,080
people can be.

270
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:03,350
The Lannisters and the Martells
have hated each other for years,

271
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:05,653
but you've fallen
in love with Trystane.

272
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:08,405
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

273
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,240
You happen to fall
in love with the man

274
00:28:10,275 --> 00:28:12,359
you were assigned to marry?

275
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:14,161
My point is...

276
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:19,366
we don't choose whom we love.

277
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,702
It just, well--

278
00:28:23,838 --> 00:28:26,340
it's beyond our control.

279
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:28,258
- I sound like an idiot.
- No, you don't.

280
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,844
What I'm trying to say--
what I'm trying

281
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:32,179
and failing to say--

282
00:28:32,213 --> 00:28:33,597
I know what
you're trying to say.

283

No, I'm afraid you don't.

284
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,718

A sellsword from the fighting
pits, a disgraced knight.

00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,508
The queen intends to remove
your family from power.

329
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:40,260
And I intend to help her do it.

330
00:32:40,295 --> 00:32:42,470
You've been here
for how many days now?

331
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,464
I've fought for her for years.

332
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:46,099
Since she was little
more than a child.

333
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:48,385
- You betrayed her.
- Careful now.

334
00:32:48,436 --> 00:32:50,804
And she exiled you.
Twice, I believe.

335
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:52,472
The second time thanks to you.

336
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,808
Don't blame me for
your crimes, Mormont.

337
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:57,561
He's right.
Our queen exiled Jorah.

338
00:32:57,612 --> 00:33:00,614
And he's right.
Jorah saved her life.

339
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,649
Perhaps she feels
differently about him now.

340
00:33:02,651 --> 00:33:05,594
Perhaps not. The only way
we'll know is if we ask her.

341
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,906
Tyrion: <i>Fine, fine. I
suppose he can join us.</i>

342
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,491
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

343
00:33:11,493 --> 00:33:14,745
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

344
00:33:14,796 --> 00:33:17,497
Forgive me, but why
would we bring you?

345
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:20,334
Pardon me?

346
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:22,502
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

347
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:25,389
Not precisely, but I have other
skills that would be useful.

348
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:27,424
Can you fight?

349
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,842
I have fought.

350
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:30,677
I don't claim to be
a great warrior.

351
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:32,813
Are you good on a horse?

352
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,181
Middling.

353
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:36,350
So mainly you talk.

354
00:33:36,352 --> 00:33:38,568
And drink.
I've survived so far.

355
00:33:38,603 --> 00:33:41,989
Which I respect, but you would
not help us on this expedition.

356
00:33:43,908 --> 00:33:45,959
You would help us
here in Meereen, though.

357
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,829
None of us have experience
governing a city

358
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,080
except for him.

359
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:52,115
You want to prove
your value to the queen?

360
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:53,500
Prove it right here in Meereen.

361
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,286
He's a foreign dwarf that
barely speaks the language.

362
00:33:56,337 --> 00:33:57,788
Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?

363
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,706
They wouldn't.

364
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:01,625
They will listen to Grey Worm.

365
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,293
I'll come with you.

366
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:05,379
I'll find our queen.

367
00:34:05,381 --> 00:34:07,848
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

368
00:34:07,882 --> 00:34:10,133
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

369
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:13,303
But you still can't go.

370
00:34:13,388 --> 00:34:15,055
The people believe in you.

371
00:34:15,057 --> 00:34:16,890
They know you speak
for the queen.

372
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:18,859
It's true.

373
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,894
Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.

374
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:24,231
If you leave, half this city
will consume the other half.

375
00:34:24,282 --> 00:34:26,533
And Missandei.

376
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,486
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

377
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:32,289
Certainly not me.

378
00:34:32,323 --> 00:34:34,408
The queen's closest confidante,

379
00:34:34,459 --> 00:34:37,127
the commander of the Unsullied,

380
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:39,913
and a foreign dwarf
with a scarred face.

381
00:34:41,132 --> 00:34:42,582
Good fortune, my friends.

382
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,501
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

383
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:46,586
Try not to ruin her.

384
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:50,090
Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.

385
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:52,225
Let's find some good horses.

386
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,644
We have so much to talk about.

387
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:15,115
<i>(dragon screeches)</i>

388
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:20,420
<i>(birds chirping)</i>

389
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:29,596
Varys:
Hello, old friend.

390
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:35,135
I thought we were so happy
together until you abandoned me.

391
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:39,806
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

392
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:42,192
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

393
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,478
if one knows how to listen.

394
00:35:45,696 --> 00:35:47,364
They tell me you've
already found favor

395
00:35:47,398 --> 00:35:49,483
with the Mother of Dragons.

396
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:52,285
Well, she didn't execute me,

397
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,655
so that's a promising start.

398
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,791
Now the heroes
are off to find her

399
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:59,993
and I'm stuck here

400
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:03,630
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

401
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,415
Any advice for an old comrade?

402
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:06,967
Information is the key.

403
00:36:07,001 --> 00:36:09,553
You need to learn your enemy's
strengths and strategies.

404
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:14,091
You need to learn which of your
friends are not your friends.

405
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:17,427
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

406
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,513
If only.

407
00:36:21,182 --> 00:36:24,317
A grand old city

408
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:27,070
choking on violence,
corruption, and deceit.

409
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:30,073
Who could possibly
have any experience

410
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,943
managing such a massive,
ungainly beast?

411
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,867
I did miss you.

412
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:43,787
Oh, I know.

413
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,770
<i>(dragon growls)</i>

414
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,277
We have to go home.

415
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:16,736
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

416
00:37:16,821 --> 00:37:18,905
Does it hurt?

417
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:23,577
We have to go home.

418
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:28,215
Drogon.

419
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:30,467
Can you take me back to Meereen?

420
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:37,090
How far did you carry me?

421
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:40,644
(groans)

422
00:37:45,183 --> 00:37:47,651
Drogon, we need to return.

423
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,436
My people need me.

424
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:56,943
(hisses)

425
00:37:58,162 --> 00:38:02,115
(growling)

426
00:38:03,084 --> 00:38:04,701
(gasps)

427
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:23,720
Well, there's no food.

428
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:26,856
At the very least, you
could hunt us some supper.

429
00:39:18,693 --> 00:39:20,660
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

430
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,927
(horse whinnies)

431
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,639
(horses neigh)

432
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:54,277
<i>(men whooping)</i>

433
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,451
<i>(men whooping)</i>

434
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,499
<i>(lock clicks)</i>

435
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,286
<i>(door opens)</i>

436
00:40:57,758 --> 00:41:00,043
(whimpers)

437
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:05,799
Confess.

438
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,805
Confess.

439
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,151
I have sinned.

440
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,987
I see that now.

441
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:30,740
How can I have been
so blind for so long?

442
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,961
I want to be clean again.

443
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,381
I want absolution.

444
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:44,170
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

445
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:45,905
And by its holy light--

446
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,475
You wish to make a confession?

447
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:54,147
Once I've confessed,
will I be free?

448
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:57,183
Your Grace will be dealt
with according to her sins.

449
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,788
The Mother have mercy, then.

450
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:06,893
I lay with a man outside the
bonds of marriage. I confess.

451
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:08,661
Name him.

452
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,234
Lancel Lannister.

453
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:17,504
Your cousin
and the king's squire.

454
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:20,373
- I was lonely and afraid.
- You had a husband.

455
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,425
A husband off whoring
every chance he--

456
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,378
His sins do not pardon your own.

457
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,466
May the gods forgive me.

458
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:33,353
Other men?

459
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:35,722
No.

460
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,941
No others?

461
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,194
No.

462
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:44,731
<i>Speaking falsehoods before
the gods is a great crime.</i>

463
00:42:44,782 --> 00:42:46,316
<i>You understand this?</i>

464
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,034
I do.

465
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:52,155
There are those
that say your children

466
00:42:52,206 --> 00:42:55,041
were not fathered
by King Robert,

467
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:58,661
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

468
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,580
A lie.

469
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,916
A lie from the lips
of Stannis Baratheon.

470
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,635
He wants the throne, but his
brother's children stand in his way.

471
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:08,922
So he claims they are
not his brother's.

472
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:10,974
That filth.

473
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:14,561
There is not one shred
of truth to it.

474
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,729
I deny it.

475
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:20,233
Good.

476
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:24,771
But these are terrible charges.

477
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:27,440
And the realm must know
the truth of them.

478
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:29,943
If Your Grace has given
honest testimony,

479
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:32,161
your trial will prove
your innocence.

480
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:34,614
Trial?
I have confessed.

481
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,316
To a single sin.

482
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,284
Others you have denied.

483
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:42,121
Your trial will separate the
truths from the falsehoods.

484
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:47,677
I bow to the wisdom
of Your High Holiness.

485
00:43:49,647 --> 00:43:51,965
But if I might beg

486
00:43:51,967 --> 00:43:54,601
for just one drop
of the Mother's mercy.

487
00:43:56,687 --> 00:43:59,639
I haven't seen my son--

488
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:02,442
I don't know how long it's been.

489
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:04,310

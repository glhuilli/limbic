1
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:08,219
Surrender by nightfall,
or this ends with blood.

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,638
We all die today.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,480
We don't need to die,
not if we have help.

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,164
You're not the only ones
who owe your lives to Jon Snow.

5
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,157
We're going to have a baby.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,860
<i>A reckoning will come,</i>

7
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:22,494
<i>we need the North to face it.</i>

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,029
<i>The entire North.</i>

9
00:00:25,032 --> 00:00:26,398
I have a team of men after them.

10
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:29,401
They won't get far.

11
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:34,239
Lady Sansa, I will give my
life for yours if need be.

12
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,911
 <i>Theon disobeyed
my orders.</i>

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,046
The boy's a fool.

14
00:00:41,382 --> 00:00:43,749
He is my brother.
He's Greyjoy.

15
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:46,885
Karstarks are North men.

16
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:49,421
They won't forgive the killing
of their Lord.

17
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:55,994
Stand and fight blind girl.

18
00:00:59,867 --> 00:01:00,867
See you tomorrow.

19
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,206
We won't be sailing to Westeros
any time soon.

20
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:12,511
They're dragons, Khaleesi,
they can never be tamed.

21
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:34,266
You're a warg, Bran.
It's in your blood.

22
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:36,836
 He waits for you.

23
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,406
You're the three-eyed raven.

24
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:32,924
<b><font color="#00FFFF">Improved By: Fidel33
May 2, 2016</b>

25
00:04:22,703 --> 00:04:26,038
Give him another go, Ned.

26
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,040
That's my father.

27
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:30,375
And my Uncle Benjen.

28
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,545
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

29
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:44,056
They were all so happy.

30
00:04:45,309 --> 00:04:47,142
So were you once.

31
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:55,701
<font color="#D900D9">Stop showing off.

32
00:04:55,786 --> 00:04:57,369
 Lyanna!

33
00:04:57,454 --> 00:04:59,154
My Aunt Lyanna.

34
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,657
<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

35
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:05,160
My father never talked about her.

36
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:13,752
 <i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

37
00:05:13,837 --> 00:05:18,006
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

38
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:19,174
 <i>I don't know.</i>

39
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,842
What about him?

40
00:05:22,262 --> 00:05:24,479
Wylis, come here.

41
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,737
Hodor?

42
00:05:31,822 --> 00:05:33,822
<i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

43
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:37,442
And you've got training.
Sounds like a fair match to me.

44
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:40,162
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

45
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,031
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

46
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:45,200
Hodor talks?

47
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:53,425
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

48
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,961
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

49
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:58,597
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

50
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:00,966
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

51
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:04,052
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

52
00:06:04,138 --> 00:06:05,971
So leave him be.

53
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:08,357
It is time to go.

54
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:10,475
Please, a little longer.

55
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,241
You finally show me
something I care about

56
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:27,826
and then you drag me away.

57
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:31,630
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

58
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,999
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

59
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:38,170
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

60
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,518
Wylis.

61
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,270
Hodor.

62
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:57,072
I saw you as a boy.

63
00:06:57,191 --> 00:07:00,025
You could talk.

64
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,694
What happened?

65
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,663
Hodor.

66
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,619
Where's Meera?

67
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:14,756
Hodor.

68
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:42,567
You shouldn't be here.

69
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:45,370
It's not safe outside the cave.

70
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:47,155
It's not safe anywhere.

71
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,878
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

72
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:55,080
- Hodor.
- <i>His real name is Wylis.</i>

73
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:59,301
And he could talk and
fight and-- and then--

74
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,636
What's wrong?

75
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:07,759
The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

76
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:10,061
And we're going to fight it in there?

77
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:41,626
Brandon Stark needs you.

78
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,681
For what?
I sit in there

79
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,100
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

80
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:51,770
He isn't going to stay here forever.

81
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:55,307
And out there he needs you.

82
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:23,969
<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>

83
00:09:24,054 --> 00:09:26,388
Open the door and the men inside

84
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,757
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

85
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:38,817
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

86
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:44,439
Nobody needs to die tonight.

87
00:09:48,245 --> 00:09:50,495
I've never been much of a fighter.

88
00:09:57,671 --> 00:09:59,838
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

89
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:08,847
Come on.

90
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:57,095
Attack!

91
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:07,155
Fight, you cowards!

92
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,473
You fucking traitor.

93
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:43,641
The only traitors here are the ones

94
00:11:43,777 --> 00:11:46,728
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

95
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:50,315
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

96
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,034
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

97
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:55,153
Until you.

98
00:12:04,998 --> 00:12:08,166
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

99
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,284
<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>

100
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:49,040
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

101
00:12:50,293 --> 00:12:51,843
Bodies to burn.

102
00:12:59,636 --> 00:13:02,854
 <i>Shh, hey.</i>

103
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:06,474
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

104
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,726
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

105
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:11,813
All of a sudden she looks my way.

106
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:14,783
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

107
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:17,318
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

108
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:20,071
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

109
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:23,074
<font color="#D900D9">She's never seen anything like it.

110
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,543
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

111
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,829
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

112
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:29,664
Ooh!

113
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:33,718
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

114
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:36,421
Well, you all know me.

115
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,556
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

116
00:14:56,586 --> 00:14:57,886
Get out of my way.

117
00:14:58,004 --> 00:14:59,971
King's orders, Your Grace.

118
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:04,809
What are the king's orders?

119
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:07,679
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

120
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:09,063
for your own protection.

121
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:13,685
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

122
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:17,822
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

123
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:21,492
I would like to speak to my son.

124
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:24,028
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

125
00:15:54,144 --> 00:15:56,477
She grew up.

126
00:15:56,563 --> 00:15:58,563
 <i>Almost.</i>

127
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:01,316
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

128
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:05,820
I expect it was Mother.

129
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,905
Your mother wouldn't do that.

130
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:09,324
Yes, she would.

131
00:16:11,828 --> 00:16:14,495
Are you angry with her?

132
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:17,498
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

133
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,301
She has every right to be here.

134
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,922
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

135
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:26,809
If she had tried--

136
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:28,819
They're not putting
your mother in a cell ever again.

137
00:16:29,346 --> 00:16:31,312
Not while I'm here.

138
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,317
Why haven't you gone to see her?

139
00:16:40,023 --> 00:16:42,357
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

140
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:44,826
Don't you think I know that?

141
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,581
I'm sorry.

142
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,419
But I can't.

143
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:55,870
Why not?

144
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,875
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

145
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,844
what did I do?

146
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:08,132
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

147
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,018
what did I do?

148
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,471
We all fail sometimes.

149
00:17:13,606 --> 00:17:16,974
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

150
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,528
If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

151
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:22,313
what good am I?

152
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,483
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

153
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:30,154
Your Grace.

154
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,956
Lord Commander.

155
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:34,792
I want to see my wife.

156
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:37,211
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

157
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,715
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

158
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:43,751
The king must wait as well.

159
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:46,304
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

160
00:17:56,683 --> 00:17:58,683
You're a bold man.

161
00:18:00,353 --> 00:18:01,903
On the contrary.

162
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:04,605
I fear a great deal.

163
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:07,859
The Father, the Mother,

164
00:18:07,994 --> 00:18:10,111
the Warrior.

165
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,257
Do you know why we use these stones?

166
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:27,845
To remind us not to fear death.

167
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:31,215
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

168
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:33,551
You must long for the next life.

169
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:37,054
In truth, I fear that, too.

170
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,108
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

171
00:18:40,226 --> 00:18:42,860
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

172
00:18:42,946 --> 00:18:44,729
and atoned for her sin.

173
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:47,031
What about my sins?

174
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,820
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

175
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:57,125
I killed my own cousin.

176
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,160
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

177
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:01,579
I helped him escape their justice.

178
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,833
What atonement do I deserve?

179
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,471
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

180
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,007
Oh, the gods won't mind.

181
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,560
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

182
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:19,680
Go on, then.

183
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:23,401
I deserve it.
We all do.

184
00:19:23,486 --> 00:19:26,103
We are weak, vain creatures.

185
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:29,073
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

186
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:47,375
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

187
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,343
I don't.

188
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:52,346
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

189
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,131
I've fought against worse odds.

190
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:57,185
No doubt many of us would fall.

191
00:19:57,303 --> 00:20:00,304
But who are we, hmm?

192
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,107
We have no names, no family.

193
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:07,111
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

194
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,614
And yet together,

195
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,366
we can overthrow an empire.

196
00:20:42,682 --> 00:20:44,265
 <i>Mother.</i>

197
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:58,663
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

198
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,866
Gold.

199
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:04,452
Good. It was always her color.

200
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,007
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

201
00:21:12,378 --> 00:21:14,762
<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was--</i>

202
00:21:17,383 --> 00:21:20,601
I didn't want to lose you again.

203
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,520
I understand.

204
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,524
I'm glad to see you.

205
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:32,229
I know I should have come sooner.

206
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:35,700
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

207
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,986
It's all right.

208
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,991
No, it isn't.

209
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:48,412
I should have executed all of them.

210
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,331
I should have pulled down the sept

211
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:54,502
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

212
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:56,921
as you would have for me.

213
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:00,591
You raised me to be strong...

214
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:04,345
and I wasn't.

215
00:22:05,732 --> 00:22:07,815
But I want to be.

216
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:12,236
Help me.

217
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,275
Always.

218
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:49,190
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

219
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:55,646
Meaning no offense.

220
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:58,566
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

221
00:22:58,651 --> 00:22:59,950
I do not make dwarf jokes.

222
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:02,153
You think them.

223
00:23:02,238 --> 00:23:06,657
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

224
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:10,578
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

225
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:13,130
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

226
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:16,300
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

227
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:19,003
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

228
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:21,589
The Masters have retaken both cities.

229
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:26,343
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

230
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:32,400
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

231
00:23:32,518 --> 00:23:34,235
They are not eating.

232
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:37,104
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

233
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,907
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

234
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,860
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

235
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:46,280
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

236
00:23:46,365 --> 00:23:48,666
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

237
00:23:48,751 --> 00:23:51,118
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

238
00:23:51,204 --> 00:23:54,171
I drink and I know things.

239
00:23:56,209 --> 00:23:59,376
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

240
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:01,962
ranged over hundreds of miles.

241
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,848
Then Daenerys's ancestors

242
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:06,767
started chaining them up in pens.

243
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,853
A few generations later,

244
00:24:08,938 --> 00:24:12,606
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

245
00:24:12,725 --> 00:24:15,643
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

246
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,196
Missandei,

247
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:22,817
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

248
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:26,570
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

249
00:24:26,706 --> 00:24:28,706
Never.

250
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,958
Dragons are intelligent.

251
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:33,911
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

252
00:24:33,996 --> 00:24:36,330
They have affection for their friends

253
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:38,249
and fury for their enemies.

254
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,419
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

255
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:45,589
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

256
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,899
I'm friends with your mother.

257
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:28,359
I'm here to help.

258
00:26:28,494 --> 00:26:30,527
Don't eat the help.

259
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:36,700
When I was a child,

260
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:40,454
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

261
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,173
I begged him for one of you.

262
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:46,760
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

263
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:50,848
"It could be little like me."

264
00:26:57,556 --> 00:27:01,692
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

265
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,229
Then my father told me

266
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:09,233
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

267
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:12,453
I cried myself to sleep that night.

268
00:27:21,497 --> 00:27:23,464
But here you are.

269
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:33,617
Next time I have an idea like that,

270
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:35,486
punch me in the face.

271
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:51,335
What's your name?

272
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,843
What's your name?

273
00:28:59,979 --> 00:29:03,347
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

274
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:06,183
<font color="#D900D9">You don't believe that.

275
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,600
Who are you?

276
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
No one.

277
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:44,721
If a girl says her name,

278
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:47,858
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

279
00:29:47,943 --> 00:29:50,227
A girl has no name.

280
00:29:50,362 --> 00:29:52,563
If a girl says her name,

281
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:54,731
a man will feed her tonight.

282
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:57,284
A girl has no name.

283
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:00,370
If a girl says her name,

284
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:02,790
a man will give her eyes back.

285
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,794
A girl has no name.

286
00:30:14,386 --> 00:30:16,503
Come.

287
00:30:24,847 --> 00:30:26,763
Leave it.

288
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:29,933
<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

289
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,195
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

290
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:45,782
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

291
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:47,584
They obviously had help.

292
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,587
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

293
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:54,124
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

294
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,627
We know where she's going.

295
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:58,462
Her brother's at Castle Black.

296
00:30:58,547 --> 00:31:00,264
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

297
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:02,432
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

298
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:05,602
So was I, Father.

299
00:31:05,688 --> 00:31:07,771
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

300
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:10,140
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

301
00:31:10,226 --> 00:31:12,809
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

302
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:16,813
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

303
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:20,817
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow--

304
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:23,871
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

305
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:26,657
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

306
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:30,410
We don't need
every house in the North.

307
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:33,130
<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

308
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:37,084
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

309
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:40,137
With their support,
none could challenge us.

310
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:44,224
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

311
00:31:44,343 --> 00:31:47,311
It's time for new blood in the North.

312
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:59,106
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

313
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:01,024
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

314
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,994
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

315
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:07,247
 <i>My lords.</i>

316
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:09,700
<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

317
00:32:09,835 --> 00:32:11,785
A boy.

318
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,371
<i>Red-cheeked and healthy.</i>

319
00:32:14,506 --> 00:32:17,708
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

320
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:28,802
Congratulations, Father.

321
00:32:30,306 --> 00:32:33,056
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

322
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:39,947
You'll always be my firstborn.

323
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,700
Thank you for saying that.

324
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:46,036
It means a great deal to me.

325
00:33:22,524 --> 00:33:24,775
Maester Wolkan,

326
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,745
<i>send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.</i>

327
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:32,582
Poisoned by our enemies.

328
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:40,957
How did he die?

329
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,297
Poisoned by his enemies.

330
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:50,300
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

331
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:53,553
Forgive me, my lord.

332
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,775
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

333
00:34:00,362 --> 00:34:02,362
She's resting, my lord.

334
00:34:05,734 --> 00:34:07,784
At once, my lord.

335
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,644
There he is.

336
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,680
Isn't he wonderful?

337
00:34:40,352 --> 00:34:42,152
May I hold him?

338
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,572
Of-- of course.

339
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:57,584
Little brother.

340
00:34:58,704 --> 00:35:00,620
Lord Bolton sent for us.

341
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:02,372
Have you seen him?

342
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:14,134
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

343
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,570
Where is Lord Bolton?

344
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,582
Down!

345
00:35:45,717 --> 00:35:48,585
 <i>It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>

346
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,139
<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.</i>

347
00:35:58,263 --> 00:36:01,398
Ramsay, where is your father?

348
00:36:02,734 --> 00:36:04,401
Ramsay.

349
00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:14,411
Where is Lord Bolton?

350
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:23,003
I am Lord Bolton.

351
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:35,015
Ramsay.

352
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:36,800
Ramsay, please.

353
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:39,519
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

354
00:36:44,977 --> 00:36:46,893
Please.

355
00:36:46,979 --> 00:36:48,979
Ramsay.

356
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:52,699
He's your brother.

357
00:36:55,654 --> 00:36:58,154
I prefer being an only child.

358
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:21,344
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

359
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,313
I don't think he hurt her.

360
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:26,516
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

361
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:30,487
You don't know which way she went?

362
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:32,856
I spent three days looking for her.

363
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:34,407
She disappeared.

364
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,245
How'd she look?

365
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,530
She looked good.

366
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:43,583
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

367
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:46,620
No, she wouldn't be.

368
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,707
What happened at Winterfell?

369
00:38:02,387 --> 00:38:05,972
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

370
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:09,025
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

371
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:16,783
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

372
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:38,555
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

373
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,723
It's not safe.

374
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:41,141
He won't stop hunting us.

375
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:42,926
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

376
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:45,478
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

377
00:38:45,597 --> 00:38:48,431
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

378
00:38:48,517 --> 00:38:50,183
I won't let him.

379
00:38:50,268 --> 00:38:52,268
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

380
00:38:54,072 --> 00:38:57,273
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

381
00:38:57,409 --> 00:39:01,077
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

382
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:06,082
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

383
00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:10,537
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

384
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:12,455
I don't want to be forgiven.

385
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,960
I can never make
amends to your family

386
00:39:17,095 --> 00:39:18,545
for the things I've done.

387
00:39:20,515 --> 00:39:22,932
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

388
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,273
You're not coming with us?

389
00:39:32,444 --> 00:39:35,729
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

390
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,815
I would have died to get you there.

391
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:58,051
May I take one of the horses?

392
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:03,807
Where will you go?

393
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:08,478
Home.

394
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:21,191
 <i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

395
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:23,526
And the ironborn who held it?

396
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:26,863
They died fighting to a man.

397
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,667
What is dead may never die.

398
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:32,952
What is dead may never die.

399
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:35,038
But they did

400
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:37,841
and our invasion died with them.

401
00:40:37,926 --> 00:40:41,044
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

402
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:42,796
Then we will take more.

403
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:46,132
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

404
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:50,720
Because I order it.

405
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:52,856
We can defeat anyone at sea,

406
00:40:52,941 --> 00:40:55,141
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

407
00:40:55,227 --> 00:40:56,726
against mainland armies.

408
00:40:56,812 --> 00:40:59,062
Not if our captains defy my orders,

409
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:03,616
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

410
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:05,702
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

411
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:06,903
Then where is he?

412
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:09,456
Where is your kingdom?

413
00:41:09,574 --> 00:41:13,576
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

414
00:41:13,662 --> 00:41:15,745
That war is over.

415
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:17,580
The last time
we provoked them too far,

416
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:20,383
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

417
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:22,418
<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

418
00:41:22,554 --> 00:41:24,337
<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

419
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:27,056
And I lost three sons.

420
00:41:28,393 --> 00:41:30,343
The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

421
00:41:30,428 --> 00:41:32,345
Well, the other four are dead.

422
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,682
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

423
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:37,600
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

424
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:40,403
or I will make another heir who will.

425
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:21,027
Let me pass.

426
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:26,816
You fool, move aside for your king.

427
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:29,786
Haven't I always, brother?

428
00:42:39,631 --> 00:42:44,000
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

429
00:42:44,085 --> 00:42:47,470
What is dead may never die.

430
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:52,642
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

431
00:42:52,727 --> 00:42:54,978
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

432
00:42:55,063 --> 00:42:58,147
You can mock our god without my help.

433
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:01,017
I don't mock the Drowned God.

434
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:03,987
I am the Drowned God.

435
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:05,939
From Oldtown to Qarth,

436
00:43:06,024 --> 00:43:09,609
when men see my sails, they pray.

437
00:43:18,503 --> 00:43:21,921
<font color="#D900D9">You're old, brother.

438
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,873
<i>You've had your time.</i>

439
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:26,259
Now let another rule.

440
00:43:26,378 --> 00:43:29,545
I heard you lost your mind

441
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:32,715
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

442
00:43:32,801 --> 00:43:38,187
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

443
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:39,806
They did.

444
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:44,477
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

445
00:43:44,562 --> 00:43:46,479
I needed silence.

446
00:43:47,782 --> 00:43:50,033
What kind of an ironborn

447
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:54,037
loses his senses during a storm?

448
00:43:54,122 --> 00:43:57,991
I am the storm, brother.

449
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:00,376
The first storm and the last.

450
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,913
And you're in my way.

451
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:46,422
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

452
00:44:46,508 --> 00:44:49,842
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

453
00:44:49,961 --> 00:44:51,961
Pull his bones down to your depths

454
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:54,847
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

455
00:44:54,966 --> 00:44:57,266
 What is dead may never die.

456
00:45:06,444 --> 00:45:08,978
I'm going to find out who did this.

457
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:12,148
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

458
00:45:13,818 --> 00:45:16,619
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

459
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:19,539
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

460
00:45:19,657 --> 00:45:21,708
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

461
00:45:21,826 --> 00:45:23,659
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

462
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:27,046
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

463
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:31,501
Perhaps you'll win.

464
00:45:31,586 --> 00:45:34,804
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

465
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,840
And perhaps not.

466
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:56,442
Come in.

467
00:46:02,534 --> 00:46:06,202
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

468
00:46:06,337 --> 00:46:08,421
You interrupt nothing.

469
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:23,269
I assume you know why I'm here.

470
00:46:24,556 --> 00:46:26,055
I will after you tell me.

471
00:46:26,191 --> 00:46:28,391
It's about the Lord Commander.

472
00:46:28,476 --> 00:46:30,643
The former Lord Commander.

473
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,780
Does he have to be?

474
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:39,485
What are you asking?

475
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:47,210
Do you know of any magic...

476
00:46:48,913 --> 00:46:50,546
that could help him?

477
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:51,998
Bring him back?

478
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:54,717
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

479
00:46:54,803 --> 00:46:56,969
Can it be done?

480
00:46:57,088 --> 00:46:59,639
There are some with this power.

481
00:46:59,757 --> 00:47:02,308
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

482
00:47:02,427 --> 00:47:03,476
Have you seen it done?

483
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:09,182
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

484
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:12,401
but the priest
who did it--

485
00:47:12,487 --> 00:47:14,403
it shouldn't have been possible.

486
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:17,657
But it was.
It could be now.

487
00:47:17,775 --> 00:47:20,076
Not for me.

488
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:26,282
Not for you?

489
00:47:29,954 --> 00:47:33,623
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

490
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:36,792
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

491
00:47:36,928 --> 00:47:39,512
Everything I believed,

492
00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:43,049
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

493
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:44,717
all of it was a lie.

494
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:51,057
You were right all along.

495
00:47:51,142 --> 00:47:53,893
The Lord never spoke to me.

496
00:47:53,978 --> 00:47:55,945
Fuck him, then.

497
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,947
Fuck all of them.

498
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:03,369
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

499
00:48:03,488 --> 00:48:06,822
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

500
00:48:09,911 --> 00:48:12,662
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

501
00:48:12,797 --> 00:48:17,300
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

502
00:48:19,254 --> 00:48:21,470
I never had this gift.

503
00:48:21,556 --> 00:48:23,506
Have you ever tried?

504
00:52:06,531 --> 00:52:09,031
Please.

505
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:11,005

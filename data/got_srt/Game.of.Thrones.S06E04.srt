1
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,820
Where you gonna go?

2
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,522
South.

3
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:23,592
What are you gonna do?

4
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:25,394
Get warm.

5
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,970
I was with you at Hardhome.

6
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:38,607
We saw what's out there.

7
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,076
We know it's coming here.

8
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,611
How can you leave us now?

9
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:45,214
I did everything I could. You know that.

10
00:02:45,316 --> 00:02:48,784
- You swore a vow. - Aye, I pledged
my life to the Night's Watch.

11
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,652
- I gave my life.
- For all nights to come.

12
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,189
They killed me, Edd! My own brothers.

13
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,157
You want me to stay here after that?

14
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:58,794
Riders approaching!

15
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:00,930
Open the gate!

16
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,525
This is good soup.

17
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:42,164
Do you remember those kidney
pies Old Nan used to make?

18
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,834
With the peas and onions?

19
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,472
We never should have left Winterfell.

20
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:53,342
Don't you wish we could go
back to the day we left?

21
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:59,014
I want to scream at myself,
"Don't go, you idiot."

22
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:01,183
How could we know?

23
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:05,387
I spent a lot of time thinking
about what an ass I was to you.

24
00:05:07,358 --> 00:05:09,424
I wish I could change everything.

25
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,659
We were children.

26
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:12,361
I was awful, just admit it.

27
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:16,966
You were occasionally awful.

28
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,868
I'm sure I can't have been great fun.

29
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,737
Always sulking in the corner
while the rest of you played.

30
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,672
- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

31
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:25,774
- Forgive me.
- All right.

32
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:27,877
All right, I forgive you.

33
00:05:45,196 --> 00:05:47,062
You'd think after thousands of years,

34
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:49,731
the Night's Watch would have
learned how to make a good ale.

35
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,436
Where will you go?

36
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:58,774
Where will we go?

37
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:02,244
If I don't watch over you, Father's
ghost will come back and murder me.

38
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,581
Where will we go?

39
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:09,184
I can't stay here, not
after what happened.

40
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:11,320
There's only one place we can go.

41
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:13,522
Home.

42
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,858
Should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?

43
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,593
We'll take it back from them.

44
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,032
I don't have an army.

45
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:25,234
How many wildlings did you save?

46
00:06:25,336 --> 00:06:26,936
They didn't come here to serve me.

47
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,305
They owe you their lives.

48
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:32,574
You think they'll be safe here if Roose
Bolton remains Warden of the North?

49
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:35,044
- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.

50
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:38,647
It's ours and Arya's and
Bran's and Rickon's.

51
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,882
Wherever they are, it
belongs to our family.

52
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,318
We have to fight for it.

53
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,553
I'm tired of fighting.

54
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:49,325
It's all I've done since I left home.

55
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:51,360
I've killed brothers
of the Night's Watch.

56
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:54,129
I've killed wildlings. I've
killed men that I admire.

57
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:57,666
I hanged a boy younger than Bran.

58
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:04,506
I fought and I lost.

59
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:11,847
If we don't take back the
North, we'll never be safe.

60
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,750
I want you to help me.

61
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:19,855
But I'll do it myself if I have to.

62
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:25,094
My lady.

63
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:27,796
Ser Davos.

64
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,801
Will you stay here at Castle Black?

65
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:36,638
I will do as Jon Snow commands.

66
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,540
You serve Jon Snow now?

67
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,943
He's the prince that was promised.

68
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,448
Forgive me, my lady, I
thought that was Stannis.

69
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,527
What happened down there?

70
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:03,798
There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.

71
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:07,936
And Shireen?

72
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,571
What happened to the princess?

73
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:12,374
I saw what happened.

74
00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,310
I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.

75
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:17,312
My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.

76
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,014
We've met before.

77
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,849
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

78
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:25,087
Before Renly was assassinated
with bloodmagic.

79
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:27,889
That's in the past now.

80
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,193
Yes, it's in the past.

81
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:33,828
It doesn't mean I forget.

82
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,898
Or forgive.

83
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,402
He admitted it, you know.

84
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:42,304
Who did?

85
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,473
Stannis.

86
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:46,708
Just before I executed him.

87
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:34,689
The Defender of the Vale!

88
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,425
Uncle Petyr!

89
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:44,899
My lord.

90
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,568
Come and see.

91
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,304
I missed your name day. Go on.

92
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:53,708
A falcon!

93
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,177
A gyrfalcon.

94
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,745
The greatest and rarest of birds.

95
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,548
Last time I saw you, Baelish,

96
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,852
you told me you were taking Sansa
Stark home with you to the Fingers.

97
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:05,220
Indeed I was.

98
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:07,523
And yet not long ago,
we received reports

99
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,725
that she has been married to
Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

100
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,396
On our way to the Fingers, we were set
upon by a large force of Bolton men.

101
00:10:14,498 --> 00:10:17,102
Seemed to know exactly
when we were traveling

102
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:19,068
and exactly whom we were transporting.

103
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,769
Do you take me for a fool?

104
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,738
Tell me, Lord Royce,

105
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,209
how many people knew of my
travel plans with Sansa Stark?

106
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:30,612
I shared my intentions with you

107
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:32,847
and no one else.

108
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:36,718
Slander a man in his own home,

109
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,621
you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.

110
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:44,359
Your home is the Vale. The Lord
of the Vale stands before us.

111
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,229
And only his judgment concerns me.

112
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,337
Shall we throw him
through the Moon Door?

113
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,513
My lord.

114
00:11:04,615 --> 00:11:09,184
My lord, I have always been
faithful to House Arryn.

115
00:11:09,286 --> 00:11:12,254
To your father, to your
mother, and now to you.

116
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:14,856
Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?

117
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:26,268
Lord Royce has served the Vale well.

118
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,105
He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.

119
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:33,742
If we could trust his absolute loyalty,

120
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:36,411
he would make a capable
commander in the wars to come.

121
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:43,518
You can trust my absolute
loyalty, my lord.

122
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,421
I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?

123
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:55,029
Fine.

124
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:04,573
I bring good news.

125
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:07,242
My friends in the North tell me
Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

126
00:12:07,344 --> 00:12:09,110
I expect she's headed to Castle Black

127
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,546
where her brother serves
as Lord Commander.

128
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,850
But she won't be safe there, not
with the Boltons after her.

129
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:19,755
She's my cousin.

130
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:23,592
We should help her.

131
00:12:23,694 --> 00:12:26,361
That was my instinct as well.

132
00:12:26,463 --> 00:12:28,997
Our lord has spoken.

133
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,534
Gather the Knights of the Vale.

134
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:35,671
The time has come to join the fray.

135
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,043
You invite the enemy into our city?

136
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:43,812
I did.

137
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:46,381
As a clever man once told me,

138
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:49,150
"We make peace with our
enemies, not our friends."

139
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:52,220
I don't make peace with
the queen's enemies.

140
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:53,422
I kill the queen's enemies.

141
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:54,989
Yes, that's the military approach.

142
00:12:55,091 --> 00:12:56,658
And how has that worked here in Meereen?

143
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,060
I represent the diplomatic approach.

144
00:12:59,162 --> 00:13:01,296
Our queen tried to make
peace with the Masters

145
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,365
and they tried to murder her.

146
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:06,401
We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.

147
00:13:06,503 --> 00:13:09,805
Trust me. My own recent
experience with slavery

148
00:13:09,906 --> 00:13:11,807
has taught me the horrors
of that institution.

149
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:13,308
How many days were you a slave?

150
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:15,377
Long enough to know.

151
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:18,513
Not long enough to understand.

152
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,590
I bought this dwarf for
a single gold honor.

153
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,759
And somehow you've risen

154
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:33,762
to the top of the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

155
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,664
It's most impressive.

156
00:13:35,766 --> 00:13:38,600
And now you speak for the
Good Masters of Astapor.

157
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:41,035
Here's to reversals of fortune.

158
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:42,704
We came here to meet the queen

159
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:45,206
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

160
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:49,110
Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.

161
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:52,146
We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.

162
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,950
Take your dragons and
your mercenaries and go.

163
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:58,620
Queen Daenerys won't
stay in Meereen forever.

164
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,489
Her path takes her westward.

165
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,924
When we last met, I offered her ships

166
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:06,895
so she could return to Westeros where
she belongs. She refused them.

167
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:09,097
She refused them because
hundreds of thousands

168
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,165
of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.

169
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,702
As they have since the dawn of time.

170
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:16,971
- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?

171
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,907
You still follow orders.

172
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:21,543
Just because your master
has silver hair and tits

173
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,378
doesn't mean she's not a master.

174
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,915
Friends, friends, friends, please.

175
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:31,553
There have always been those with wealth
and power and those with nothing.

176
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:34,656
That is the way of the world. I'm not
here to change the way of the world.

177
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:37,225
Slavery is the way of our world.

178
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:40,796
You don't need slaves to make money.

179
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:43,765
There haven't been slaves in
Westeros for hundreds of years

180
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,801
and I grew up richer than any of you.

181
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:51,506
But our queen recognizes that she erred

182
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,242
by abolishing slavery

183
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:57,178
without providing a new
system to replace it.

184
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,049
So here is the queen's proposal.

185
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,018
Slavery will never return to Meereen,

186
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,855
but she will give the other
cities of Slaver's Bay

187
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,924
time to adjust to the new order.

188
00:15:09,025 --> 00:15:10,325
What does that mean?

189
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:13,562
Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,

190
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,397
we will give you seven
years to end the practice.

191
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,338
Slaveholders will be compensated

192
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,174
for their losses, of
course, at fair prices.

193
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:28,777
In exchange, you will cut off

194
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,612
your support for the Sons of the Harpy.

195
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:32,246
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.

196
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:35,416
Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

197
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:39,554
I do hope you accept, my friends.

198
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:41,523
You will not receive a better offer.

199
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:47,829
Let us sail on the tide of freedom

200
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:50,164
instead of being drowned by it.

201
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:54,636
And as a parting gift to
our honored guests...

202
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,413
Give freedom a chance.

203
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:08,850
See if it doesn't taste every bit
as good as what came before.

204
00:16:19,536 --> 00:16:21,677
_

205
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:25,138
_

206
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,670
_

207
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:31,806
Perhaps I should translate for you.

208
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,508
We speak the Common Tongue.

209
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,078
- Excellent.
- You met with the slavers today.

210
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,580
I did.

211
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:40,682
Our brothers and sisters
died fighting this scum.

212
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:43,919
Now you invite them to our
city and drink wine with them.

213
00:16:46,623 --> 00:16:50,025
I imagine this room was built

214
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:53,161
so the rulers could
intimidate the ruled.

215
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:57,032
But I am not your ruler.

216
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,434
I'm not the Breaker of Chains.

217
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,703
I'm not the Unburnt.

218
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:06,007
And I am certainly not
the Mother of Dragons.

219
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,142
You are a stranger here.

220
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:11,179
So why do you represent Meereen
in these talks with our enemies?

221
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,716
Because our queen chose
me as her advisor.

222
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:16,918
Until she returns from her travels...

223
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,519
When does she return?

224
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,056
Soon. You have my word.

225
00:17:21,157 --> 00:17:24,826
We don't know you. We don't trust you.
We know Torgo Nudho.

226
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:26,861
We fight with him against the Masters.
We trust him.

227
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,799
And that is exactly why Grey Worm
took part in these negotiations.

228
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:34,535
As commander of the Unsullied, he
knows how to defeat the slavers

229
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,370
and he knows when it
is time to make peace.

230
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:39,340
You have made peace with the slavers?

231
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:40,770
We offered terms.

232
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,943
_

233
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:44,939
_

234
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:49,897
_

235
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:58,299
_

236
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:00,848
_

237
00:18:00,889 --> 00:18:02,361
_

238
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,247
_

239
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,715
_

240
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:10,747
_

241
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:14,315
_

242
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:22,339
_

243
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,752
_

244
00:18:33,263 --> 00:18:36,665
- Do not use me for your lies.
- Those men respect you.

245
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,067
They respect me because
they know who I am.

246
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:41,169
- They know I am loyal.
- As do I.

247
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:43,538
I am loyal to my queen, not you.

248
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,506
If you betray her work,
you are my enemy.

249
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:48,743
I am not betraying her work. I
am trying to save her city.

250
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:51,279
You promised the slavers
they could keep slavery.

251
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,580
For a short time.

252
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:55,416
Seven years is not a
short time for a slave.

253
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:56,985
You're right.

254
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,520
Slavery is a horror that
should be ended at once.

255
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:02,157
War is a horror that
should be ended at once.

256
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,925
I can't do both today.

257
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,459
You are wrong to trust these men.

258
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:08,997
I don't trust the Masters. I
trust their self-interest.

259
00:19:09,099 --> 00:19:10,765
They're trustworthy if they're convinced

260
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,034
that working with me is
in their self-interest.

261
00:19:13,136 --> 00:19:16,004
You don't know them. You
don't understand them.

262
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:17,772
We are not human in their eyes.

263
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:20,141
They look at me and see a weapon.

264
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,243
They look at her and see a whore.

265
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:25,113
They look at me and they see
a misshapen little beast.

266
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:27,248
Their contempt is their weakness.

267
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,852
They'll underestimate us every time and
we will use that to our advantage.

268
00:19:32,122 --> 00:19:34,022
You will not use them.

269
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:36,825
They will use you. That is what they do.

270
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,580
You all right?

271
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:02,917
Why don't you sit and catch your breath?

272
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:05,987
I'm fine.

273
00:20:06,089 --> 00:20:08,289
I don't think you could ride the dragon.

274
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:10,524
20 years ago, maybe.

275
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,894
- What?
- Our queen.

276
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:16,364
She's wild, you know. Don't
let her size fool you.

277
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,200
It's hard enough for me
and I'm a young man.

278
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:23,071
You, I don't think your
heart could take it.

279
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:29,244
Must make you angry that
our queen chose me.

280
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:32,480
Makes me sad. You'll
disappoint her before long.

281
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:35,016
- She'll move on.
- We'll all disappoint her before long.

282
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,952
We need each other right now. After
we're done needing each other...

283
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:41,489
Oh, I don't want to fight
you, Jorah the Andal.

284
00:20:41,591 --> 00:20:43,291
What do I have to gain?

285
00:20:43,393 --> 00:20:46,060
If I win, I'm the shit
who killed an old man.

286
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:49,297
If I lose, I'm the shit who
was killed by an old man.

287
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:54,202
You didn't get much discipline
as a child, did you?

288
00:20:54,304 --> 00:20:56,004
None.

289
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,779
The road running through the Horse Gate,

290
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:06,681
they call that the godsway.

291
00:21:06,783 --> 00:21:09,483
Eastern Market, Western Market.

292
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:13,788
When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed
to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,

293
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,125
the widows of the dead khals.

294
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:19,160
That's where they would have taken her,

295
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:22,463
the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

296
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:32,073
What are you doing?

297
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:34,709
It's forbidden to carry
weapons in the sacred city.

298
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:38,213
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into
their city and steal their khaleesi?

299
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:40,181
If they spot us and we're unarmed,

300
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,750
we'll say we're traders heading
for the Western Market.

301
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:44,485
But if they see weapons...

302
00:21:44,587 --> 00:21:46,287
You're asking a dog to
hand over his teeth.

303
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,389
There's 100,000 of them down there.

304
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,991
We can't fight our way out.

305
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:52,827
We wait till dark, and
then we'll find her.

306
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:05,874
I'm very attached to this knife.

307
00:22:16,652 --> 00:22:19,254
Don't worry. It didn't touch you.

308
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,857
You know what happens?

309
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,658
I know what happens.

310
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,396
I'll do it myself.

311
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,631
I should have been born a Dothraki.

312
00:23:32,135 --> 00:23:34,376
Come on.

313
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:36,090
_

314
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,080
_

315
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:43,270
_

316
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,691
_

317
00:23:44,747 --> 00:23:45,884
_

318
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,116
_

319
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:52,047
_

320
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,113
_

321
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:00,496
_

322
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:54,708
Told you, I'm very
attached to this knife.

323
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,778
You all right?

324
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,048
If they find a body with a stab wound,

325
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,517
the whole city will be looking for us.

326
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:35,308
_

327
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:40,572
_

328
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,554
_

329
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:45,727
_

330
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:48,017
_

331
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:50,676
_

332
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:55,392
_

333
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,096
_

334
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:04,431
_

335
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:06,704
_

336
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:09,594
_

337
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:15,843
_

338
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:19,231
_

339
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,076
_

340
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:25,974
_

341
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,760
_

342
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:30,430
_

343
00:26:31,893 --> 00:26:33,571
_

344
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:36,876
_

345
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,013
_

346
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:40,903
_

347
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:44,432
_

348
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:45,740
_

349
00:26:46,547 --> 00:26:49,013
_

350
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:53,049
_

351
00:26:53,103 --> 00:26:55,571
_

352
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:01,040
_

353
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,494
_

354
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:05,219
_

355
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:07,637
_

356
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:12,415
_

357
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:15,183
- No, don't hurt her.
- She'll give us away.

358
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:17,017
We have to go now.

359
00:27:21,824 --> 00:27:24,525
We will never get out
of Vaes Dothrak alive.

360
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:27,027
All we can do is try.

361
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,330
No.

362
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:31,632
We can do more than that.

363
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,334
And you're going to help me.

364
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,596
_

365
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,694
_

366
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,646
_

367
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:46,474
If I were to let you leave
right now, where would you go?

368
00:28:47,366 --> 00:28:49,243
What would you seek out?

369
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,681
I'd go to my brother,

370
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:55,249
my husband, my family.

371
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:59,453
Of course, but for you, that
means seeking out money,

372
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:02,423
finery, power.

373
00:29:02,525 --> 00:29:06,327
Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.

374
00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:08,329
I'm not maligning you.

375
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:11,365
I sought those things out, too.

376
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,668
To the exclusion of all else.

377
00:29:15,538 --> 00:29:17,305
My father was a cobbler.

378
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:21,575
He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.

379
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,178
He was a simple man and
he made simple shoes.

380
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,682
But I found that the more
work I put into my shoes,

381
00:29:27,784 --> 00:29:28,982
the more people wanted them.

382
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:32,152
Fine leather, ornamentation,

383
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:36,123
detailing, and time.

384
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:37,925
Time most of all.

385
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:40,628
Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.

386
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,463
Quality takes time.

387
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:44,498
Yes.

388
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,667
I imagine you've worn a year

389
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:49,737
of someone's life on your back.

390
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,172
The highborn liked to cover
their feet with my time

391
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:55,275
and they paid well for the privilege.

392
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,944
I used their money

393
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,780
to buy a taste of their
lives for myself.

394
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,015
Each time I indulged,

395
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:06,220
I felt myself ascending
to something better.

396
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:08,322
And one day you walked
through a graveyard

397
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:10,123
and realized it was all for nothing

398
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:12,760
and set out on the
path to righteousness.

399
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:15,463
Book of the Stranger, verse 25.

400
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,098
You know "The Seven-Pointed Star."

401
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,868
Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.

402
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:24,805
Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.

403
00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:27,908
You're close.

404
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:31,078
But it wasn't a graveyard.

405
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,013
It was a feast.

406
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:35,383
I bought old fine wine

407
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:37,518
and young pretty girls

408
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,321
and invited my friends to
come and share it all.

409
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:44,825
We passed around the wine,
passed around the women,

410
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,661
and soon we fell into a stupor.

411
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:53,734
I woke before dawn.

412
00:30:53,836 --> 00:30:56,970
I could barely stand.

413
00:30:57,072 --> 00:31:01,809
Everyone else was asleep on
the couches or on the floor,

414
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:06,547
lying in heaps next to
their fine clothes.

415
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,082
The truth of their bodies laid bare.

416
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:13,987
I could smell them

417
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:17,425
beneath the incense and the perfume

418
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:21,228
and the fine food that had
already started to turn.

419
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:26,567
And I saw it with perfect clarity.

420
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,970
I saw what my sins were.

421
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,341
The gold I had, the wine I
drank, the women I used,

422
00:31:34,444 --> 00:31:38,646
my ceaseless struggle to
maintain my position.

423
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,586
It was all part of a story.

424
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,058
A story I was telling
myself about who I was.

425
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:53,627
A collection of lies

426
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,696
that would disappear in the light.

427
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,700
The people I was trying
to climb away from,

428
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:01,268
the beggars in the street,

429
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,903
the poor,

430
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,774
they were closer to the
truth than I ever was.

431
00:32:06,876 --> 00:32:09,409
So what did you do?

432
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,378
I left to go and find them.

433
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:15,082
I didn't even put on my shoes.

434
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:19,086
I walked out the door
and never went back.

435
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:26,794
Come, let's go and see him.

436
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:30,297
- Who?
- Your brother.

437
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,648
Loras.

438
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:56,156
Loras.

439
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,911
Listen to me.

440
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:18,879
You need to stay strong.

441
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:24,785
I can't stay strong.

442
00:33:24,887 --> 00:33:26,654
I never was strong.

443
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,522
You are strong.

444
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,958
You are the future of our house,

445
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,459
the future of our family.

446
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:35,128
I don't care about that.

447
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:39,366
Have you... have you told them that?

448
00:33:39,468 --> 00:33:40,935
That you don't care?

449
00:33:41,037 --> 00:33:45,039
I just want it to stop.

450
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,276
Help me.

451
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:58,619
They want me to help you.

452
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:02,723
They want me to help tear you down.

453
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:05,793
That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.

454
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:09,563
And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.

455
00:34:09,665 --> 00:34:11,364
Let them win.

456
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:14,768
Just make it stop.

457
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,071
Please.

458
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:20,608
All right.

459
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:28,983
And now, how to avert disaster
with our current predicament.

460
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:31,251
This High Sparrow.

461
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:34,321
I have dealt with fanatics of
every description, Your Grace.

462
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:38,058
Not setting them off, that's
the most important thing.

463
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,361
You are beset with enemies
both within and without.

464
00:34:41,463 --> 00:34:43,130
What are you doing here?

465
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:49,269
I am advising the king on
our current predicament.

466
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:52,740
- Leave.
- I am a member of the small council.

467
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:54,074
The king...

468
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,810
Is this a small council meeting?

469
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:58,178
Obviously not.

470
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,381
I'm here to lend my
wisdom and my support.

471
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:04,718
Thank you for your
counsel, Grand Maester.

472
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,720
That will be all for now.

473
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,588
Your Grace.

474
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:35,916
Since I've missed the past
several small council meetings,

475
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,786
I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.

476
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:42,790
I've been thinking about
the High Sparrow.

477
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,559
As have we all, unfortunately.

478
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:48,562
We need to be careful in
dealing with such a man.

479
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:52,465
To prevent things from
escalating any further.

480
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:56,837
We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.

481
00:35:56,939 --> 00:35:59,339
He has Margaery. We
can't put her at risk.

482
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:02,176
- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.

483
00:36:02,277 --> 00:36:04,111
What did they do to me?

484
00:36:04,213 --> 00:36:06,146
To the king's own mother?

485
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,353
It's all right.

486
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:15,889
It's done. It's in the past.

487
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:18,225
And of course

488
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:21,028
Margaery's safety is paramount.

489
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:26,266
You don't like Margaery, do you?

490
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:31,105
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

491
00:36:33,575 --> 00:36:35,175
Margaery is the queen.

492
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:39,880
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

493
00:36:39,982 --> 00:36:42,783
Not just for their own
sake, but for everyone's.

494
00:36:44,754 --> 00:36:48,188
The High Sparrow has no
respect for kings or queens.

495
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,124
No respect for anything in this world.

496
00:36:50,226 --> 00:36:53,127
He has no use for the
things of this world.

497
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:56,864
He wants to knock them down
and replace them with what?

498
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,066
With fantasies.

499
00:36:59,168 --> 00:37:01,168
With beggars in the street.

500
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:02,469
With nothing.

501
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,039
Mother...

502
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,309
there's something I want to tell you.

503
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,080
Something the High Sparrow told me.

504
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,584
You've spoken with him?

505
00:37:19,554 --> 00:37:22,990
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told...

506
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:25,893
It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly

507
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,762
given his constant
prattling about the truth.

508
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,401
I am your mother.

509
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:37,470
You can always trust me.

510
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,882
The small council meeting has been
postponed on the king's orders.

511
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,318
I would have thought we were
perfectly clear the first time.

512
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,487
- You're not welcome. - You once
spoke of your respect for our father

513
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,324
because he understood the necessity
of working with one's rivals.

514
00:37:57,426 --> 00:38:02,262
My dear, you have been stripped
of your dignity and authority,

515
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,365
publically shamed, and
confined to the Red Keep.

516
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:07,701
What's left to work with?

517
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:10,204
Cersei is the mother of the king.

518
00:38:10,306 --> 00:38:13,006
She has the king's ear and his trust.

519
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:15,042
And the king has been speaking regularly

520
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:18,545
with the High Sparrow about
Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

521
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:20,280
The High Sparrow seized power

522
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:24,252
knowing full well we'd bicker amongst
ourselves instead of seizing it back.

523
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:26,053
Here we are. Well done to us.

524
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:28,255
Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms

525
00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:30,190
rests in his dirty peasant hands.

526
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:33,060
In a few days, he'll
have a trial for me.

527
00:38:33,162 --> 00:38:36,730
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

528
00:38:36,832 --> 00:38:40,433
Yes, Margaery will repent her sins

529
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,502
before the good people of the city.

530
00:38:42,604 --> 00:38:45,072
Oh, no.

531
00:38:45,174 --> 00:38:47,975
That cannot happen.

532
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:49,877
That will not happen.

533
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:51,644
I agree.

534
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:57,184
You've got the second
largest army in Westeros.

535
00:38:57,286 --> 00:38:58,718
You'll bring them into the city,

536
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,488
stop Queen Margaery's
humiliation before it starts,

537
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,991
and take her back into Crown custody.

538
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:07,827
The king has ordered me to take no
action against the High Sparrow

539
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,031
or the Faith Militant out of
fear for the queen's safety.

540
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,966
You will take no action at all.

541
00:39:13,068 --> 00:39:15,602
When the Tyrell armies
come, you will stand down.

542
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:19,373
Are you expressly forbidden
from standing down?

543
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:22,342
No, but if the king should call...

544
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:25,212
The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

545
00:39:25,314 --> 00:39:29,449
When the High Sparrow is in
custody or dead, preferably,

546
00:39:29,551 --> 00:39:32,085
and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,

547
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:34,288
do you think the king will
be angry at the outcome?

548
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,124
You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

549
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:40,493
You hate what they've done to your son.

550
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:42,462
Do you want Lancel back?

551
00:39:42,564 --> 00:39:44,431
Or have you given him up for good?

552
00:39:46,235 --> 00:39:48,468
Of course I want him back.

553
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:53,473
Then stand aside

554
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:56,776
and let the people that took
him from you be destroyed.

555
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:02,149
If it doesn't go as planned,

556
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:04,617
the sparrows have many
friends in this city.

557
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,454
We'll have civil war. Many will die.

558
00:40:07,556 --> 00:40:09,957
Many will die no matter what we do.

559
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:13,460
Better them than us.

560
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:12,285
They told me you were home
and I didn't believe it.

561
00:41:14,356 --> 00:41:17,090
"Theon Greyjoy?" I said.

562
00:41:17,192 --> 00:41:19,526
"He's dead.

563
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:21,995
He's been dead a long time."

564
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:27,100
He let you go?

565
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:28,668
I escaped.

566
00:41:31,206 --> 00:41:33,040
I can't hear you.

567
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:34,807
I escaped.

568
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,912
Look at me.

569
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:48,988
Look at me!

570
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:53,093
Men died trying to rescue you.

571
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:54,794
Good men.

572
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:56,363
My men.

573
00:41:57,832 --> 00:41:59,466
I'm sorry.

574
00:41:59,568 --> 00:42:01,601
You were my brother.

575
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:04,737
You were a spoiled little
cunt, but you were my brother

576
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,806
and I risked everything for you

577
00:42:06,908 --> 00:42:08,275
and you betrayed me.

578
00:42:08,377 --> 00:42:10,544
I know. I know and I'm sorry.

579
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:11,945
Stop saying that.

580
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:14,247
He broke me.

581
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:17,050
He broke me into 1,000 pieces.

582
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,518
- I know.
- You don't know.

583
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,121
He sent us one of those pieces.

584
00:42:21,223 --> 00:42:23,190
That's why I came for you.

585
00:42:29,231 --> 00:42:31,131
Why did you come here?

586
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,832
Where else could I go?

587
00:42:32,934 --> 00:42:36,636
You heard Father was dead and you
thought you'd claim the crown?

588
00:42:36,738 --> 00:42:38,705
No, no. I only heard he
died after we docked.

589
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:41,708
You happen to show up on Pyke
right before the kingsmoot?

590
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,276
I didn't know.

591
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:49,483
You think any ironborn
wants you to be king

592
00:42:49,585 --> 00:42:51,384
after what you've done?

593
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:53,453
I don't want to be king.

594
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:56,789
What do you want?

595
00:42:56,891 --> 00:42:58,925
I should have listened to you.
You're the only one...

596
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:01,361
That doesn't matter anymore.
Stop crying.

597
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:03,463
Look at me.

598
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:06,733
Tell me what you want.

599
00:43:11,106 --> 00:43:13,773
You should rule the Iron Islands.

600
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:17,010
Let me help you.

601
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:45,838
They've cleaned you up nicely.

602
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:51,311
You know who I am?

603
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:52,612
A lord.

604
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,648
Yes.

605
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:57,317
A lord.

606
00:43:57,419 --> 00:43:59,352
You've seen my banners?

607
00:44:00,689 --> 00:44:02,822
The flayed man.

608
00:44:02,924 --> 00:44:05,758
Does that worry you at all?

609
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,360
You eat them after?

610
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:12,265
No.

611
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:15,368
Then I've seen worse.

612
00:44:39,528 --> 00:44:41,561
You served the Starks?

613
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:44,197
Aye. They put me in chains

614
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:46,165
and put a sword at my throat,

615
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:47,534
so I served them.

616
00:44:47,636 --> 00:44:51,003
The Starks have been
gone for a long time,

617
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:53,873
but you kept protecting Rickon.

618
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:57,477
He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

619
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:59,346
I served his family a long time.

620
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,581
Didn't get no wages.

621
00:45:01,683 --> 00:45:04,817
Way I see it, I'm owed.

622
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:09,556
Be that as it may,

623
00:45:09,658 --> 00:45:12,125
Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.

624
00:45:12,227 --> 00:45:13,893
He's mine.

625
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:17,029
So what use could I
possibly have for you?

626
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,768
I can give you what you want.

627
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:24,103
And you're sure you know what that is?

628
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:29,208
Same thing men always want.

629
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:33,513
And when they really want it,
they give it a bath first.

630
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:44,090
You're a good talker.

631
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:48,227
I like that.

632
00:45:55,804 --> 00:45:59,539
You're a much better
talker than Theon Greyjoy.

633
00:46:00,942 --> 00:46:02,742
That so?

634
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,144
I had to work hard to get him talking.

635
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:07,747
But he talked.

636
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:09,516
They all do.

637
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:12,385
He told me everything.

638
00:46:12,487 --> 00:46:15,322
All about the Stark boys,

639
00:46:15,424 --> 00:46:17,657
who helped them escape,

640
00:46:17,759 --> 00:46:19,091
and how she did it.

641
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:49,456
Open the gate!

642
00:47:36,538 --> 00:47:38,638
Sorry about the food.

643
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,774
It's not what we're known for.

644
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:43,342
That's all right. There are
more important things.

645
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:50,182
A letter for you, Lord Commander.

646
00:47:51,986 --> 00:47:53,887
I'm not Lord Commander anymore.

647
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:16,375
"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow.

648
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:19,712
You allowed thousands of
wildlings past the Wall.

649
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:21,280
You have betrayed your own kind.

650
00:48:21,382 --> 00:48:23,249
You have betrayed the North.

651
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:26,486
Winterfell is mine, bastard.
Come and see.

652
00:48:28,089 --> 00:48:30,156
Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.

653
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:40,834
His direwolf's skin is on my floor.

654
00:48:40,936 --> 00:48:43,269
Come and see. I want my bride back.

655
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:47,106
Send her to me, bastard, and I will not
trouble you or your wildling lovers.

656
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:50,309
Keep her from me and I will
ride north and slaughter

657
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:53,913
every wildling man, woman, and
babe living under your protection.

658
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,450
You will watch as I skin them living.
You... "

659
00:48:59,788 --> 00:49:01,420
Go on.

660
00:49:01,523 --> 00:49:03,322
It's just more of the same.

661
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:11,798
"You will watch as my soldiers
take turns raping your sister.

662
00:49:13,301 --> 00:49:14,601
You will watch as my dogs

663
00:49:14,703 --> 00:49:17,303
devour your wild little brother.

664
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,976
Then I will spoon your eyes from their
sockets and let my dogs do the rest.

665
00:49:23,077 --> 00:49:27,013
Come and see. Ramsay
Bolton, Lord of Winterfell

666
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:28,848
and Warden of the North."

667
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:36,322
Lord of Winterfell and
Warden of the North.

668
00:49:36,424 --> 00:49:39,325
His father's dead.

669
00:49:39,427 --> 00:49:40,960
Ramsay killed him.

670
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,429
- And now he has Rickon.
- We don't know that.

671
00:49:43,532 --> 00:49:45,932
Yes, we do.

672
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:48,535
How many men does he have in his army?

673
00:49:50,605 --> 00:49:54,340
I heard him say 5,000 once when he
was talking about Stannis's attack.

674
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:56,809
How many do you have?

675
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:59,879
That can march and fight?

676
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:01,714
2,000.

677
00:50:03,018 --> 00:50:05,718
The rest are children and old people.

678
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,359
You're the son of the last
true Warden of the North.

679
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:17,096
Northern families are loyal.
They'll fight for you if you ask.

680
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:23,436
A monster has taken our
home and our brother.

681
00:50:24,873 --> 00:50:27,874
We have to go back to
Winterfell and save them both.

682
00:57:19,555 --> 00:57:27,555

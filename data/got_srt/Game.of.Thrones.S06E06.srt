1
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:48,267
Burn them all!

2
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,835
Where's my sister?

3
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,606
Burn them all!

4
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,471
Please.

5
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,552
Burn them. Burn them all!

6
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,935
<i>Burn them all!</i>

7
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,013
Meera.

8
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:10,082
They found us.

9
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,259
I'm so sorry.

10
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,858
Come with me, now.

11
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,198
The dead don't rest.

12
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,726
It's so green.

13
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,494
Oh, yes.

14
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,396
Once you get south of the Riverlands,

15
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,399
very different sorts of
trees start to take over.

16
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:11,203
Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

17
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,675
The odd willow.

18
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,244
And of course now that summer's over,

19
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,147
you'll start seeing the
autumn colors coming in.

20
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:28,654
Still, you'll find more green
here than anywhere else.

21
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:32,424
You're nervous.
You're a nervous talker.

22
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,631
That's not any better
being a nervous mute.

23
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,201
I didn't think
I'd ever come back here

24
00:06:42,303 --> 00:06:44,570
after my father made me
renounce my title

25
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,538
and inheritance

26
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,074
and, well, threaten
to kill me if I didn't.

27
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:53,011
A person just doesn't
feel welcome at that point.

28
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,317
And I certainly didn't expect to
be introducing him to my family.

29
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,254
So you know what to tell them.

30
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:04,223
That Little Sam is your baby.

31
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:05,891
Yes, now that's very important.

32
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,493
If he thinks that
Little Sam is his grandchild,

33
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,462
he'll take you in.

34
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,966
He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.

35
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,969
And you can help teach him. Huh?

36
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:20,005
What did you tell
your family about me?

37
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,878
I told them I met you in the North.

38
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,846
Did you tell them how far north?

39
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:31,049
Well, it wasn't a very
large piece of parchment.

40
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,831
You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?

41
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,720
You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

42
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,922
The thing is...

43
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,358
my father doesn't like wildlings.

44
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,829
He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

45
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:47,499
so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.

46
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:52,738
I think we're here.

47
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,502
Sam.

48
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,837
Oh, Sam.

49
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,073
Oh, hello, Mother.

50
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,744
I never thought I'd see you again.

51
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,447
- You look wonderful.
- Oh.

52
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,685
Talla?

53
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,554
Gods, you're a woman now.

54
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:45,123
Father says I have
to marry Symun Fossoway.

55
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,260
- He has yellow teeth--
- That's enough, Talla.

56
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:54,633
Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.

57
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,171
Oh, my.

58
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,373
You are lovely.

59
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:05,877
I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

60
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:12,050
Oh, and this,

61
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,553
this is our son Samwell.

62
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,594
Hello, little one.

63
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,064
It's me, your grandmother.

64
00:09:27,835 --> 00:09:29,267
May I hold him?

65
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,269
Yes, of course.

66
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,175
Oh.

67
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,711
You have a curious mind, I can tell.

68
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,081
You'll be a scholar like your father.

69
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:47,219
Where is Father?
And Dickon?

70
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,154
They're on a hunt.

71
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:52,391
<i>They'll join us for dinner.</i>

72
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:55,827
Come inside.
Such a journey.

73
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,629
You must be exhausted.

74
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:01,099
Come, you'll be wanting a
bath after all that travel.

75
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,301
Oh, and a dress for dinner.

76
00:10:03,404 --> 00:10:05,070
You can wear one of mine.

77
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,005
What's your color?

78
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,474
Midnight blue or silver?

79
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,676
Silver, maybe.
Come.

80
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,146
You can choose one of my
bedrooms if you want.

81
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:25,690
Is there no other way?

82
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,359
You're afraid for her?

83
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:30,228
Of course I'm afraid for her!

84
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,401
It just seems very dangerous.

85
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,937
She'll be protected the entire way.

86
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,606
The Faith Militant are very stern

87
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,309
with those who overstep their bounds.

88
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,714
And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

89
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,751
I suspect the gods will
predispose the common people

90
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,387
to gentleness on her behalf.

91
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,956
She's truly opened her heart to them.

92
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,827
She's always been very devoted
to the poor and the unfortunate.

93
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,763
And now she's devoted
to the gods as well.

94
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,201
Would you like to see her?

95
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,290
Have they hurt you?

96
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,792
Have they mistreated you?

97
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,962
- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.

98
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,763
More than you could know.

99
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,032
We'll be together again soon

100
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,869
and everything will be
better than it was before.

101
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,904
Better how?

102
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,372
Soon the--

103
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,643
walk of atonement.

104
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,280
He says there's no other way.

105
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,483
Have you spoken to him at
all, the High Sparrow?

106
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,953
Yes, a few times.

107
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,388
Have you?

108
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,990
Yes, I have.

109
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,759
He's not quite what we
thought he was, is he?

110
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:12,030
You think I'm mad.

111
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,199
I sound mad.

112
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,234
No.
No, you don't.

113
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,370
You--
you could never.

114
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:20,138
You're right, he's not.

115
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,940
He's a lot more--

116
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,575
He is.

117
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,777
There's something about him.

118
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,946
His way of looking at the world.

119
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:35,487
It's not an easy thing admitting
to yourself what you really are.

120
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,522
It's taken me a while.

121
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:39,658
He's helped me.

122
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,660
What are you talking about?

123
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:46,097
You're a good person. You've
always been a good person.

124
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,367
You're the best person I know.

125
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,470
I was just telling him about
your devotion to the poor.

126
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,372
Ah, yes, I visited their hovels

127
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,876
and I fed them soup and I made
sure I was seen doing it.

128
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:02,681
I never gave them what
they really needed, though.

129
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:07,452
I've had lots of time to think about
how good I was at seeming good.

130
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:11,656
All those stories I told
myself about who I was

131
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,392
and why I did the things I did.

132
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,296
There were so many lies
in those stories.

133
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,800
I don't understand.

134
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,069
It's all right.
It really is.

135
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,639
It's such a relief
to let go of those lies.

136
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:34,579
What about Loras?

137
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:38,116
I love my brother.

138
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:42,053
I will always love my brother.

139
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,458
His soul is pure and perfect.

140
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,060
His sins don't erase that purity,

141
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,196
they only obscure it.

142
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:55,700
He just needs to atone for them.

143
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,236
We all do.

144
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,539
Sooner or later, one way or another.

145
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:05,910
The gods have a plan for us all.

146
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:24,095
It's hard to walk in this.

147
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,199
It's beautiful.

148
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,870
You're beautiful.

149
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:22,921
This venison, it's very tasty.

150
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,557
Is it from today's hunt?

151
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,559
Well, no.

152
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,594
We haven't been able
to cure that one yet.

153
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,596
<i>This is last week's.</i>

154
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:35,233
Oh, of course.
Sorry.

155
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,302
Long journey.

156
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:39,904
Brought it down from 70 yards.

157
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,606
One shot.

158
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:45,143
Oh, that's a fair distance.

159
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,113
So do you do much hunting
up at the Wall?

160
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,882
Oh, yes.
Yes.

161
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,550
A good amount.

162
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,286
North of the Wall,

163
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,522
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

164
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,090
Mm-hmm.

165
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,059
Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

166
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,763
Rabbits.

167
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:07,132
<i>Sometimes squirrels.</i>

168
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:14,139
I say "we," it's my
friend Jon mostly.

169
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,040
Sometimes Edd.

170
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,809
<i>Oh, and Gilly.</i>

171
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:20,879
She's-- she's quite
a good hunter as well.

172
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,215
Um, huntress.

173
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,518
<i>I imagine it's
common where you're from.</i>

174
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,054
We once met a man, Lord Umber from
Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

175
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,390
<i>who said he taught all
his daughters how to hunt.</i>

176
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,993
Your father
taught you to hunt?

177
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,928
Our father would never teach us.

178
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:41,032
I think our father could learn a
thing or two from your father.

179
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,434
That's enough of that.

180
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:47,472
Samwell, would you care
for more bread?

181
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,542
Oh, yes.
Yes, please.

182
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,210
Thank you, Mother.

183
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,450
Not fat enough already?

184
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:13,231
I travelled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.

185
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,567
- He wants me to--
- I read your letter.

186
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,370
You're to be a maester.

187
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,805
Yes.

188
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,674
And once I have my chain,

189
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:25,276
I'll return to Castle Black.

190
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,580
I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

191
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,383
Something resembling a man at least.

192
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:37,322
You managed to stay soft and fat.

193
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,826
Your nose buried in books.

194
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:46,364
Spending your life reading about
the achievements of better men.

195
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,934
I'll wager you still can't sit
a horse or wield a sword.

196
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:53,137
Randyll, to be maester of the
Night's Watch is a great honor.

197
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,573
He can wield a sword.

198
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,010
He killed a Thenn.

199
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,247
He killed a white walker.

200
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,750
There's no such thing.

201
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,889
I saw it with my own eyes on
our way down to Castle Black.

202
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:14,626
He drove a dagger
into the walker's heart.

203
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:18,229
He risked his own life
to save mine more than once.

204
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,933
He's a greater warrior than
either of you will ever be.

205
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,272
Your way down to Castle Black?

206
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,343
<i>Where did he kill a white walker?</i>

207
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,048
Where are you from?

208
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,484
How'd you come to meet my son?

209
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,988
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

210
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,090
- Where?
- Gilly.

211
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,359
- North of the Wall.
- <i>North of the Wall?</i>

212
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,832
You're a wildling.

213
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:06,244
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
against these savages for centuries

214
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,881
and here I sit hosting one in my hall

215
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,084
<i>thanks to my son.</i>

216
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,854
See that sword?

217
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,660
It's called Heartsbane.

218
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,464
It's been in our family
for 500 years.

219
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,633
<i>It's Valyrian steel.</i>

220
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,202
<i>Only a handful of them
left in the world.</i>

221
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:35,173
It's supposed to go to my
firstborn son after I die.

222
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,908
To him.

223
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:41,579
He will never wield that sword.

224
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,783
If he were to become
Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

225
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,186
it would be the end of this house.

226
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,825
I took you for a Mole's
Town whore when I saw you

227
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,493
and I made my peace with that.

228
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,362
Who else would have him?

229
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,932
But I overestimated him.

230
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,202
<i>No.</i>

231
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:10,141
It was a wildling whore
that seduced my son.

232
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,412
This you getting back at me, boy?

233
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:20,752
Hmm? Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

234
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,657
<i>And you got what you
were after, didn't you?</i>

235
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,028
A bastard.
A half-breed bastard.

236
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,697
Your invitation into our home.

237
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,833
Come, my dear.
Talla.

238
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:39,003
I've lost my appetite.

239
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,471
He dishonors us.

240
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,441
You dishonor yourself.

241
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,815
Your mother's a fine woman.
You're not worthy of her.

242
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,922
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
She can work in the kitchens.

243
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:01,025
The bastard will be raised here.

244
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:07,432
But this will be the last night
you ever spend at Horn Hill.

245
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:18,409
I'm sorry I let him
treat you that way.

246
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,879
I was afraid he'd turn
you and Little Sam away.

247
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:24,882
I'm not angry at you.

248
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,018
I'm angry that horrible people

249
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,620
can treat good people that
way and get away with it.

250
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:37,161
When do you have to go?

251
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,166
First light.

252
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,545
Say good-bye
to him for me.

253
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,923
You're not what
he thinks you are, Sam.

254
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:08,493
He doesn't know what you are.

255
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,831
Good-bye, Gilly.

256
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,044
- Sam?
- We're leaving.

257
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,979
- What?
- Get your things.

258
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,116
I don't have any things.

259
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:08,052
- What are you doing?
- We belong together.

260
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,054
All of us.

261
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:12,690
What about your mother and sister?

262
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,725
Oh, they'll understand.

263
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,494
Your sister's dress.

264
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,462
She won't mind.

265
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,266
Looks better on you anyway.

266
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,335
Sam.

267
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:26,504
That's your father's sword.

268
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,639
It's my family's sword.

269
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,213
Sam.

270
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:37,815
Won't he come for it?

271
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:41,619
He can bloody well try.

272
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,059
The lion and the rose are one.

273
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:50,194
I thank the gods above.

274
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,797
And to you, my beauteous bride,

275
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,932
I pledge undying love.

276
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:59,337
Hail King Joffrey.
Hail Queen Margaery.

277
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:02,073
I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

278
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,508
for there is no one fairer.

279
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:08,813
Dear Uncle, will you share my
joy and be my royal cupbearer?

280
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,682
Drink long and deep, my noble king,

281
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,018
from this cup of sweet wine.

282
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,654
The last drink he shall ever take.

283
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,689
And vengeance shall be mine.

284
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,503
Poison!

285
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:34,372
Murder!

286
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,874
I gasp.
I-- I die.

287
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,812
I limp.

288
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,048
And it was he...

289
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,251
<i>...that poisoned me.</i>

290
00:24:47,353 --> 00:24:50,254
My evil Uncle Imp.

291
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,062
Calm down, dear.

292
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:04,402
My firstborn son.

293
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:06,904
My golden lion

294
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,507
foully, falsely slain.

295
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:13,778
I pray you found a lasting peace

296
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,047
free from strife and pain.

297
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,785
Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

298
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,720
<i>Take my life instead.</i>

299
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:26,691
For I cannot face another day
when my sweet boy is dead.

300
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:29,694
<i>Oh, woe.</i>

301
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,762
Oh, grief.

302
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:36,534
Oh, darkest day,
my heart is full of sorrow.

303
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,472
All hope is lost.

304
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,608
All joy is gone.

305
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,715
And there is no tomorrow.

306
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,337
What is that I hear and smell?

307
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,107
<i>Someone I'll soon send to hell.</i>

308
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,776
It's time to see if truth they told

309
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:22,513
who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

310
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:26,717
You beast.
You beast.

311
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:31,655
You killed my wife and now
you've taken your father's life.

312
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,525
<i>No worse child
ever stained this land.</i>

313
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,128
Curse the day I named you.

314
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:50,207
My greatest crime.
Now I must flee.

315
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,110
<i>Then sail across the Narrow Sea</i>

316
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:57,348
<i>to do unto you more treachery.</i>

317
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,152
Don't fear winter.
Fear me!

318
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,024
<i>Thank you.</i>

319
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,694
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Bianca,</i>

320
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,730
<i>Clarenzo.</i>

321
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:16,467
I give you Bobono.

322
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,003
I give you Camello.

323
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,372
<i>And last but not least,</i>

324
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,607
sweet Lady Crane.

325
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:38,422
Give this a good beating. Shake
those fleas out. That's a dear.

326
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,658
That crowd was shit.

327
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,064
Girl.

328
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,500
What are you doing back here?

329
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:51,001
Nothing.

330
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:54,472
I saw you the other day
in the audience.

331
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:57,508
How many times have you
seen this stupid play?

332
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,478
Three times.

333
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,279
Did you pay?

334
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,548
No.

335
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,354
I remember when the players
came to my village.

336
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:13,057
I didn't have any money,
so I snuck in.

337
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,326
Just like you.

338
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:17,528
Saw the painted faces, the costumes,

339
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,196
listened to the songs,

340
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,733
cried when the young lovers
died in each other's arms.

341
00:28:22,835 --> 00:28:26,604
I ran off and joined them the
next day, never looked back.

342
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,540
You're very good.

343
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,375
My final speech is shit.

344
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:34,745
But to be fair to myself,
which I always like to be,

345
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,081
the writing's no good.

346
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:39,083
So change it.

347
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,654
It would all just be farting,
belching, and slapping without you.

348
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,224
How would you change it?

349
00:28:52,632 --> 00:28:55,833
The queen loves her son
more than anything.

350
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:58,969
And he was taken from her
before she could say good-bye.

351
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,071
She wouldn't just cry.

352
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,578
She would be angry.

353
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,247
She would want to kill the
person who did this to her.

354
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:15,619
What's your name?

355
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,456
Mercy.

356
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,259
You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

357
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:24,929
<i>Wonderful eyebrows.</i>

358
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:28,165
Do you like pretending
to be other people?

359
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,636
I have to go. My
father's waiting for me.

360
00:29:40,813 --> 00:29:43,547
Lady Crane, they loved you.

361
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,417
They were sweet.
Or drunk.

362
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,586
Drunkenly sweet.

363
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,254
No laugh for Ned's death.

364
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:54,058
These people are worse than animals.

365
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,962
But they loved her.
They all love her.

366
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:01,832
Yes, you are adored
by people and animals alike.

367
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,468
I do what I can with what I'm given.

368
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,470
With what you're given?

369
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,405
Well, I was thinking--

370
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,007
<i>Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?</i>

371
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,910
Full to the tits with ideas.

372
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:16,313
- I didn't mean--
- You have ideas, I have ideas,

373
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,182
he has ideas.

374
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:20,985
Why should my ideas have
any more value than yours

375
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:24,388
simply because I've been
doing this my whole life?

376
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,690
Who is anyone to judge my work?

377
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,560
This is my profession.
I know what I'm doing.

378
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,595
You have no right to an opinion.

379
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,177
Careful of that one.

380
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,050
She wants you dead.

381
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:33,891
And?

382
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:36,226
As I expected.

383
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,663
A shame.

384
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,765
A girl had many gifts.

385
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,637
You promised me.

386
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,812
Don't let her suffer.

387
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:49,333
Company, halt!

388
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:52,202
My lord.

389
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,138
My lord.

390
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:59,543
My friends, the hour has come.

391
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:03,380
Madness has overtaken this city

392
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:08,085
and grasped in its claws my children.

393
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:11,355
But now we must drive it back

394
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:14,525
under the rocks whence it came.

395
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:19,163
Madness has had its day!

396
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,668
<i>Forward, march!</i>

397
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:30,974
Rich or poor, noble or common,

398
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:35,245
if we sin, we must atone.

399
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,316
Margaery of House Tyrell

400
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,852
<i>came to us a sinner.</i>

401
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:44,321
She stood before the gods

402
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,890
in the holy sept and lied.

403
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:50,027
She turned a blind eye
to her brother's sins.

404
00:33:50,129 --> 00:33:52,696
She disgraced her house,

405
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,066
her king, and herself.

406
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,533
<i>Company, halt!</i>

407
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,902
Face front!

408
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,737
Turn!

409
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:38,408
<i>Lord Tyrell.</i>

410
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,777
Ser Jaime.

411
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,779
Sorry to interrupt.

412
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,582
<i>We're here for Queen Margaery
and Ser Loras Tyrell.</i>

413
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:48,952
Give them to us
and we'll be on our way.

414
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:53,156
I don't have the authority
to give them to you.

415
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,093
And you don't have
the authority to take them.

416
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,028
That's right.

417
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:01,465
Hyah.

418
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:09,773
<i> Lock spears!</i>

419
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:14,044
I speak for King Tommen of House
Baratheon, First of His Name.

420
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:17,214
The gods don't recognize
his authority in this matter.

421
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,050
You've already insulted
one great house.

422
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,119
<i>It won't happen twice.</i>

423
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:24,454
Every last sparrow will die

424
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:27,024
before Margaery Tyrell
walks down that street.

425
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,626
To die in the service of the gods

426
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,929
would please
each and every one of us.

427
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:34,364
We yearn for it.

428
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,909
But there is no call for it today.

429
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:51,782
There will be no walk of atonement.

430
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,167
<i>Order up.</i>

431
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:13,236
Queen Margaery has already
atoned for her sins

432
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,340
<i>by bringing another</i>

433
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:18,542
into the true light of the Seven.

434
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,742
Together we announce

435
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:54,378
<i>a new age of harmony.</i>

436
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,347
A holy alliance

437
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:00,984
between the Crown and the Faith.

438
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:20,137
<i>Long live King Tommen
and bless you, Queen Margaery!</i>

439
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,639
The Crown and the Faith

440
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,476
are the twin pillars
upon which the world rests.

441
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:31,682
Together we will restore
the Seven Kingdoms to glory.

442
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:52,202
What's happening?

443
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:54,304
He's beaten us.

444
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:56,273
That's what's happening.

445
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:14,157
When you attack the Faith,
you attack the Crown.

446
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,227
Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

447
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,930
to serve as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

448
00:38:20,032 --> 00:38:23,967
I've been a member of the Kingsguard
since before you were born.

449
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,905
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do anything.

450
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,243
I have to answer to the gods.

451
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,579
Not when you're sitting
in that chair.

452
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,319
The Crown's decision
on this matter is final.

453
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,390
Will I be walking naked
in the streets?

454
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,993
Or will I spend a few months
in the sept dungeons first

455
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:52,229
to teach me about the gods' mercy?

456
00:38:56,435 --> 00:39:00,737
You have served your house and your
king faithfully for many years.

457
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,073
And you will continue to do so.

458
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,777
But not in this city.

459
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:13,416
You've lost it?

460
00:39:15,154 --> 00:39:16,453
Yes, Father.

461
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,489
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

462
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:22,759
Presumably you still
know where it is.

463
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,461
You didn't lose Riverrun.

464
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:26,696
You let the Blackfish
take it from you.

465
00:39:26,799 --> 00:39:29,766
He surprised us. He knows the
castle better than anyone.

466
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,236
You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

467
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,339
You had him right here in this
hall and you let him leave.

468
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,942
Then when I told you to
hunt him down and kill him,

469
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,410
you couldn't find him.

470
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,612
That's what it means
to lose something.

471
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,149
Now he's come back
and taken Riverrun.

472
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,418
I don't think it's fair
to blame us--

473
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,788
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

474
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,792
swore oaths to them and their
stinking fish banners.

475
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,128
Not again.
Riverrun is ours.

476
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,564
Take it back.

477
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,199
We don't have the men.

478
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:05,635
We've got 10 times as many
men as the damn Blackfish.

479
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,772
<i> The Mallisters have
risen against us. And the Blackwoods.</i>

480
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:12,075
<i> The Brotherhood Without Banners
is rallying the commoners against us,</i>

481
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,110
<i>raiding our supply trains and camps.</i>

482
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:17,247
<i>Riverrun can
withstand a siege for a year.</i>

483
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:20,684
If I want excuses,
I'll put her in charge.

484
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:22,552
They're laughing at us.

485
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,521
All across the Riverlands

486
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:26,356
right down to King's Landing,

487
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,091
<i>they're laughing at us.</i>

488
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:30,727
I hear it in my sleep!

489
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,830
I'm not dead yet,
unfortunately for you.

490
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:38,668
And I'll not leave this world until
they all choke on that laughter.

491
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,304
Take that castle back.

492
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,275
He'll never yield, Father.

493
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:47,878
Oh, he'll yield.

494
00:40:52,384 --> 00:40:55,118
You'll show him the knife you used

495
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,922
to kill Robb Stark's child
in his whore mother's belly,

496
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:01,291
and you'll show him
the knife you used

497
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:03,526
<i>to open his niece's throat.</i>

498
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:05,595
<i>And you'll remind him who it was</i>

499
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:09,566
that got married at the Red
Wedding in the first place.

500
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,334
His nephew.

501
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:29,219
<i>Cheer up, Lord Edmure.</i>

502
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:31,388
You're going home.

503
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,991
I'm being sent to deal
with the Blackfish.

504
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,961
Apparently Walder Frey
can't manage it on his own

505
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,863
because he's 400 years old.

506
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,465
<i>Sent me with an army
to the Riverlands</i>

507
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:44,434
and a siege that could last months.

508
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,970
Better you're elsewhere
at the head of an army

509
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:48,638
than in the sept dungeons.

510
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,608
I'm not going to the Riverlands.

511
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,912
What, then?

512
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:57,447
I'm going to give Bronn

513
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,616
the largest bag of gold
anyone's ever seen

514
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:03,086
and have him gather
the best killers he knows.

515
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,556
I'll take them to the sept and I'll
remove the High Sparrow's head

516
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,491
and every other
sparrow head I can find.

517
00:42:08,593 --> 00:42:12,162
- You can't.
- He has our son! He stole our son!

518
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,264
He's torn our family apart.

519
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,700
How should we treat people
who tear us apart?

520
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:20,870
We should treat them
without mercy and we will.

521
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:23,807
But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the sept alive.

522
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:26,943
And without you,
this is all for nothing.

523
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,413
Stand at the head of our army
where you belong,

524
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,816
where Father wanted you.

525
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:35,285
Show our men where
their loyalties belong.

526
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:37,387
Show them what Lannisters are,

527
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,422
what we do to our enemies.

528
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:43,026
And take that stupid
little castle back

529
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:45,328
because it's ours
and because you can.

530
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:48,531
You'll stand trial soon.
I need to be here for you.

531
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:52,802
It will be a trial by combat.

532
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,271
I have the Mountain.

533
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:00,176
They've made us both
stronger, all of them.

534
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,580
They have no idea how strong we are.

535
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:05,982
No idea what we're going
to do to them.

536
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,995
We've always been together.

537
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,664
We'll always be together.

538
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,200
We're the only two
people in the world.

539
00:43:44,156 --> 00:43:45,989
Why did you help us?

540
00:43:49,528 --> 00:43:51,027
The Three-Eyed Raven
sent for me.

541
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,328
The Three-Eyed
Raven's dead.

542
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:54,497
Now he lives again.

543
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:09,879
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

544
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:13,149
A fearless boy.

545
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:16,319
Loved to climb the castle
walls, frighten his mother.

546
00:44:16,421 --> 00:44:18,822
Who are you?

547
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,108
Uncle Benjen.

548
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,944
<i>The last letter Jon wrote me</i>

549
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:42,879
said you had been
lost beyond the Wall.

550
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:48,451
I led a ranging party
deep into the North

551
00:44:48,553 --> 00:44:51,287
to find white walkers.

552
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,989
They found us.

553
00:44:53,091 --> 00:44:56,926
A white walker stabbed me in
the gut with a sword of ice.

554
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:00,930
Left me there to die.

555
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,432
To turn.

556
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,101
The Children found me.

557
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:08,404
Stopped the walker's
magic from taking hold.

558
00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:09,806
How?

559
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:12,208
The same way they made the
walkers in the first place.

560
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,643
You saw it yourself.

561
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:17,447
Dragonglass.

562
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:20,550
A shard of dragonglass
plunged into your heart.

563
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:25,555
You are the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

564
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:28,591
I didn't have time to learn.
I can't control anything.

565
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,663
You must learn to control it

566
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:35,665
before the Night King comes.

567
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:39,936
Drink.

568
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:45,141
One way or another,

569
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,944
he will find his way
to the world of men.

570
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,446
When he does,

571
00:45:50,549 --> 00:45:53,716
you will be there waiting for him.

572
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:57,086
And you will be ready.

573
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:19,899
<i>Everything all right?</i>

574
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:22,035
<i>How many days' ride to Meereen?</i>

575
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:23,970
<i>A week at best.</i>

576
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,474
How many ships will I need to
bring my khalasar to Westeros?

577
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,676
Dothraki and all their horses,

578
00:46:29,778 --> 00:46:32,112
the Unsullied,
the Second Sons--

579
00:46:32,214 --> 00:46:34,080
1,000 ships easily.

580
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:36,316
- Probably more.
- And who has that many?

581
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,917
Nobody.

582
00:46:38,019 --> 00:46:40,053
Nobody yet.

583
00:46:42,124 --> 00:46:45,625
So we ride for Meereen and after
that we sail for Westeros.

584
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,227
And what then?

585
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:50,096
I take what is mine.

586
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:53,032
You weren't made to sit
on a chair in a palace.

587
00:46:53,135 --> 00:46:55,468
What was I made for?

588
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,239
You're a conqueror,
Daenerys Stormborn.

589
00:47:08,417 --> 00:47:09,916
Wait here.

590

1
00:00:07,417 --> 00:00:09,484
<i>That's it. Get
it right to the top.</i>

2
00:00:09,586 --> 00:00:12,387
<i>Steady. Steady.</i>

3
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,356
Up she goes.

4
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:51,092
Hey, come on.
Put your back into it, huh?

5
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:54,162
Here you are, son.

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,035
- Oh, gentlemen, please.
- To my right.

7
00:01:00,137 --> 00:01:02,170
And you lot, come on.
Come on, get it moving.

8
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:04,673
Come on, come on.

9
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:32,057

10
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:51,873
In all my days I've never seen
a man swing an ax like that.

11
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:55,477
How many men did it take
to cut you down?

12
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:57,612
Just one.

13
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:59,180
Ooh.

14
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,549
He must have been
some kind of monster.

15
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:04,886
He was a woman.

16
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:49,330
I think some of the men
are a bit afraid of you.

17
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,433
I'm used to it.

18
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,375
When I found you, I thought
you'd been dead for days.

19
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:58,511
The way you were stinking already

20
00:04:58,613 --> 00:05:00,313
and you had bugs all over you

21
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:03,082
and bone was coming
through right there.

22
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:08,503
I was gonna give you a proper
burial and then you coughed.

23
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,942
Oh, nearly shit myself.

24
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,744
<i>I reckoned you were gonna die</i>

25
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,246
<i>by the time I loaded you
on the wagon, but you didn't.</i>

26
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,416
Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen
more times over the next few days,

27
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,918
but you didn't.
What kept you going?

28
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,057
Hate.

29
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,228
No, there's a reason
you're still here.

30
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,197
Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big
fucker and I'm tough to kill.

31
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,767
No, a reason.

32
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,002
Gods aren't done with you yet.

33
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,140
I've heard that before.

34
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,442
Man was talking about
a different god, though.

35
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,677
Well, maybe he was right.

36
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,379
I don't know much about the gods.

37
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,782
You're in the wrong line of work.

38
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,784
Oh, there's plenty
of pious sons of bitches

39
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,386
who think they know
the word of god or gods.

40
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,955
I don't. I don't even
know their real names.

41
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:02,460
Maybe it is the Seven.
Or maybe it's the old gods.

42
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,462
Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

43
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,298
Or maybe they're all
the same fucking thing.

44
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't know.

45
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,102
What matters, I believe,

46
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,205
is that there's something
greater than us.

47
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:19,143
And whatever it is, it's got
plans for Sandor Clegane.

48
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,149
You didn't know me back in my time.

49
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,220
You don't know the things I've done.

50
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,957
I've heard stories.

51
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,028
If the gods are real...

52
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,365
why haven't they punished me?

53
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,403
They have.

54
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:02,320
Your Grace.

55
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,489
What are we reading today?

56
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,158
The Book of the Mother,
Your Holiness.

57
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Chapter three, verse 12.

58
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:13,498
Ah, "As water rounds
the stones, smoothing--"

59
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,201
"Smoothing what was jagged,
so does a woman's love

60
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,337
calm a man's brute nature.

61
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,306
<i>A wife salves her husband's wounds,</i>

62
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,876
a mother sings
her son to sleep."

63
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:28,012
You learn quickly.

64
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,049
There are some who know every
verse of the sacred text,

65
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,152
but don't have a drop of the
Mother's mercy in their blood

66
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,689
and savages who can't read at all

67
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,526
who understand the Father's wisdom.

68
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,564
For years I pretended

69
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,799
to love the poor, the afflicted.

70
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:53,304
I had pity for them,
but I never loved them.

71
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,173
They disgusted me.

72
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,509
They are hard to love.

73
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,746
The poor disgust us
because they are us,

74
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,181
shorn of our illusions.

75
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,785
They show us what we'd look
like without our fine clothes.

76
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,555
How'd we smell without perfume.

77
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,693
Can I ask you
about a personal matter?

78
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,461
Of course.

79
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,634
The king mentioned
that since your reunion,

80
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,937
you haven't joined him
in the marriage bed.

81
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,674
No.

82
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,609
You have a duty, Your Grace.

83
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:35,112
To your husband,
your king, your country,

84
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,548
to the gods themselves.

85
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,750
It's just...

86
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,088
the desires that once
drove me no longer do.

87
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,892
Congress does not require desire

88
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:52,263
on the woman's part, only patience.

89
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,232
The king must have an heir

90
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,969
if we are to continue our good work.

91
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,738
Forgive me.

92
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,474
Sometimes the true path
is hard to find.

93
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,710
Hard to find

94
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:08,713
and harder still to walk upon.

95
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,282
But you've made great progress.

96
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,187
I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead.

97
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,091
My grandmother?

98
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,592
Yes.

99
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:24,929
The Queen of Thorns
is a remarkable woman,

100
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,864
a strong woman,

101
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,699
and an unrepentant sinner.

102
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,669
<i>You must teach her the new way</i>

103
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,404
<i>as she taught you the old.</i>

104
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,507
Or I fear for her safety,

105
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,242
body and soul.

106
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,783
<i>Does it move or talk?</i>

107
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,352
I want to speak with you alone.

108
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,756
Septa Unella has been my
true friend and counselor.

109
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,525
Oh, this is madness!

110
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,434
You're not in your sanctuary
now, my dear.

111
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:07,271
All I have to do is whistle and my men
will stroll in here and bash you about...

112
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,473
- Grandmother.
- ...until I tell them to stop.

113
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,976
If I tell them to stop.

114
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,479
- You could use a good bashing.
- Grandmother, please.

115
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,114
What have they done to you?

116
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,016
You marched against the High Sparrow,

117
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,018
- against the Faith.
- We marched for you.

118
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,854
The gods could have punished you
and Father, but they didn't.

119
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,956
- They showed mercy.
- And what about your brother?

120
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,658
What mercy did they show him?

121
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,629
Loras's only hope is to confess
his crimes and repent.

122
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,832
If he does, the Faith will allow
him to return to Highgarden.

123
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,168
He'll have to renounce
his name and title...

124
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,037
- Have you lost your mind?
- ...and live his life as a penitent.

125
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,674
He is the heir to Highgarden,
the future of House Tyrell.

126
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,209
He can begin again.

127
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,944
As a mindless fanatic.

128
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,879
As a free man.

129
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,516
You will leave for Highgarden today.

130
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:56,320
There is no law that says
you must stay here.

131
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,255
I am the queen.

132
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:02,326
It is my duty to serve
my husband the king.

133
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,232
But you should leave, Grandmother.

134
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,334
Your place is at home.

135
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,837
I will never leave you.
Never.

136
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,638
You must.

137
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,943
Go home.

138
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,947
Find comfort in prayer
and good works.

139
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,119
The Mother watches over us all.

140
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,161
I'll see you soon, my dear.

141
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,102
Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

142
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,382
Shall we pray?

143
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,568
<i>We said we'd
fight with you, King Crow,</i>

144
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,837
<i>when the time comes and we meant it,</i>

145
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,705
but this isn't what we agreed to.

146
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,340
<i>These aren't white walkers.</i>

147
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,276
<i>This isn't an army of the dead.</i>

148
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,712
This isn't our fight.

149
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:31,682
<i>If it weren't for
him, none of us would be here.</i>

150
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,052
All of you would be meat
in the Night King's army.

151
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,455
And I'd be a pile of charred
bones just like Mance.

152
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,758
Remember Mance's camp?

153
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,427
<i>It stretched all the way
to the horizon.</i>

154
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,563
And look at us now.

155
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,165
Look what's left of us.

156
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,768
And if we lose this, we're gone.

157
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,339
<i>Dozens of tribes,
hundreds of generations.</i>

158
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,575
<i>Be like we were never there at all.</i>

159
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,677
We'll be the last of the free folk.

160
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,281
That's what'll happen
to you if we lose.

161
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,853
The Boltons, the
Karstarks, the Umbers,

162
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,654
they know you're here.

163
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:13,657
They know that more than half
of you are women and children.

164
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,393
After they finish with me,
they'll come for you.

165
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,129
<i>You're right.</i>

166
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,865
<i>This isn't your fight.</i>

167
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,500
You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

168
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,102
I shouldn't be asking you.

169
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,971
It's not the deal we made.

170
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,941
I need you with me
if we're going to beat them,

171
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,144
and we need to beat them
if you're going to survive.

172
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:42,286
The crows killed him because
he spoke for the free folk

173
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,388
when no other southerners would.

174
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,158
He died for us.

175
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:52,663
If we are not willing to do the
same for him, we're cowards.

176
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,566
<i>And if that's what we are,</i>

177
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,269
we deserve to be
the last of the free folk.

178
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,854
Snow.

179
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,465
Are you sure they'll come?

180
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,402
We're not clever
like you southerners.

181
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,906
When we say we'll do
something, we do it.

182
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,258
I heard you were
leaving King's Landing.

183
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,428
That is hardly your concern.

184
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,398
Your grandson is still a prisoner.

185
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,300
You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

186
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,603
Loras rots in a cell because of you.

187
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:43,207
The High Sparrow rules
this city because of you.

188
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,644
Our two ancient houses
face collapse because of you

189
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,680
and your stupidity.

190
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,450
You're right.

191
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,486
I made a terrible mistake.

192
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,354
I carry it with me every single day.

193
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,956
Good.

194
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,593
I delivered an army of
fanatics onto our doorstep.

195
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,862
And now we must fight them together.

196
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,233
We need each other.

197
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,638
I wonder if you're the worst
person I've ever met.

198
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,541
At a certain age,
it's hard to recall.

199
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:22,246
But the truly vile do stand
out through the years.

200
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,515
<i>Do you remember the way
you smirked at me</i>

201
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,452
<i>when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?</i>

202
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,321
I do.
I'll never forget it.

203
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,157
You love your granddaughter.

204
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,226
<i>I love my son.</i>

205
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,730
It's the only truth I know.

206
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,832
We must defend them.

207
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:45,202
I'm leaving this wretched
city as fast as I can

208
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:49,373
before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.

209
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,442
If you're half as bright
as you think you are,

210
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,210
you'll find a way out of here, too.

211
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,912
Never.

212
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,413
I'll never leave my son.

213
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,482
What'll you do, then?

214
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:01,485
You have no support.
Not anymore.

215
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,655
Your brother's gone. The
High Sparrow saw to that.

216
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,691
<i>The rest of your family
have abandoned you.</i>

217
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,660
<i>The people despise you.</i>

218
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,229
You're surrounded by enemies,
thousands of them.

219
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,298
You're going to kill them
all by yourself?

220
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,367
<i>You've lost, Cersei.</i>

221
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,505
It's the only joy I can
find in all this misery.

222
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,548
<i>Pick the pace up.</i>

223
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,117
<i>Keep going.</i>

224
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,189
<i>Keep it moving!</i>

225
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,161
Now, that is a sorry
attempt at a siege.

226
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,898
Someone needs to teach those
sad twats how to dig trenches.

227
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,867
Someone certainly does.

228
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,587
Oh, no.
Not me.

229
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,222
I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

230
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:31,091
You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.

231
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,026
Aye, knights don't get paid.

232
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:36,730
You have better instincts than any
officer in the Lannister army.

233
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:40,901
That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.

234
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:46,073
I expect to command all the
Lannister forces before long.

235
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,208
You can be the right hand I lost.

236
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,848
You promised me
a lordship and a castle

237
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,917
and a highborn beauty for a wife.

238
00:18:57,019 --> 00:18:59,520
And you'll get all three.
A Lannister always--

239
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:02,723
Don't say it.
Don't fucking say it.

240
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:24,711
Come out and
fight us, Blackfish.

241
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,647
We have Lord Edmure.

242
00:19:28,317 --> 00:19:31,318
Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

243
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:52,873
This is your last warning.

244
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,841
Yield the castle.

245
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,089
You think I won't do it, old man?

246
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,595
I sliced your niece's
throat from ear to ear.

247
00:20:14,697 --> 00:20:18,632
And where were you? Running and
hiding like a fucking coward.

248
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:25,272
Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

249
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:38,051
Go on, then.
Cut his throat.

250
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:02,309
Lothar, is it?

251
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,611
Ser Jaime.

252
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:06,279
We didn't know you were coming.

253
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,048
'Cause you didn't set
a proper perimeter.

254
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,984
You just allowed 8,000 men
to approach unchallenged.

255
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:14,888
Good thing we're friends or we'd be
fucking you in the ass right now.

256
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,890
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

257
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,059
Whoa, whoa.

258
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:20,594
Walder.

259
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,899
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

260
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:31,405
Only a fool makes threats he's
not prepared to carry out.

261
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:34,274
Now let's say I threatened to hit you

262
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,943
unless you shut your mouth,
but you kept talking.

263
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,513
- What do you think I'd do?
- I don't give a rat's--

264
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,284
I'm here by the king's command
to take back this castle.

265
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,020
<i>Have him bathed and fed.</i>

266
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,690
Unless you'd like to take his place.

267
00:21:51,026 --> 00:21:52,626
Apologies, Ser Jaime.

268
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,027
Do as he says.

269
00:21:54,129 --> 00:21:56,530
The siege is now under my command.

270
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:59,232
The next time the Blackfish
looks out from those ramparts,

271
00:21:59,334 --> 00:22:02,369
he'll see an army at his
gates, not whatever this is.

272
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:04,638
<i>Have your lads start
digging perimeter trenches.</i>

273
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,239
Set pickets every hundred yards.

274
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:08,875
And work double-time on those
siege towers and trebuchets.

275
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:10,310
Those are our
siege towers--

276
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,879
As I said, the siege
is under my command.

277
00:22:12,981 --> 00:22:15,549
<i>If that's not to your
liking, go home.</i>

278
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,857
Get word to the Blackfish.

279
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,826
I want a parley.

280
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,828
A parley or a fight?

281
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:30,864
He's an old man.

282
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,733
You've got one hand.

283
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,935
My money's on the old boy.

284
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:56,289
Lady Mormont.

285
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:59,159
Welcome to Bear Island.

286
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,468
I remember when
you were born, my lady.

287
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,303
<i>You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.</i>

288
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:13,140
It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be, too.

289
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:15,575
I doubt it. My mother
wasn't a great beauty

290
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:16,943
or any other kind of beauty.

291
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,212
<i>She was a great warrior, though.</i>

292
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,648
She died fighting
for your brother Robb.

293
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,488
I served under your uncle
at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

294
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,658
He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.

295
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,393
I was his steward.
In fact--

296
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,663
I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?

297
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,835
Stannis Baratheon
garrisoned at Castle Black

298
00:23:41,937 --> 00:23:44,437
<i>before he marched on
Winterfell and was killed.</i>

299
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,340
He showed me the letter you wrote
to him when he petitioned for men.

300
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:49,342
- It said--
- I remember what it said.

301
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:50,944
Bear Island knows no king

302
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,713
but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.

303
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,185
Robb is gone,

304
00:23:58,287 --> 00:23:59,820
but House Stark is not.

305
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:03,089
<i>And it needs your support
now more than ever.</i>

306
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,260
I've come with my sister to ask
for House Mormont's allegiance.

307
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,340
As far as I understand, you're a Snow

308
00:24:20,442 --> 00:24:22,242
and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

309
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,411
Or is she a Lannister?

310
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:26,780
I've heard conflicting reports.

311
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,850
I did what I had to do
to survive, my lady.

312
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,719
But I am a Stark.
I will always be a Stark.

313
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:35,322
If you say so.
In any case,

314
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:38,291
you don't just want my allegiance.
You want my fighting men.

315
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:41,294
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.

316
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,163
<i>It is our duty to stop him.</i>

317
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:47,567
Even more so because he holds our
brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

318
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,805
What you have to understand,
my lady, is that--

319
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,742
I understand that I'm responsible for
Bear Island and all who live here.

320
00:24:55,844 --> 00:25:00,380
So why should I sacrifice one more
Mormont life for someone else's war?

321
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:09,489
If it please, my lady,

322
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,191
I understand how you feel.

323
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:13,727
I don't know you, Ser...?

324
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:15,829
Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

325
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,531
<i>You needn't ask your
maester about my house.</i>

326
00:25:18,634 --> 00:25:20,967
It's rather new.

327
00:25:22,471 --> 00:25:25,038
All right, Ser Davos
of House Seaworth.

328
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,107
How is it you understand how I feel?

329
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:31,945
You never thought you'd find
yourself in your position.

330
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:35,582
Being responsible for so many
lives at such a young age.

331
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,450
<i>I never thought
I'd be in my position.</i>

332
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:41,688
I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.

333
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,857
And now I find myself
addressing the lady

334
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,126
of a great house in time of war.

335
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:50,430
But I'm here because this
isn't someone else's war.

336
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,700
It's our war.

337
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:56,770
Go on, Ser Davos.

338
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:01,141
Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

339
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:03,143
made that man his steward.

340
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:06,046
He chose Jon to be his
successor because he knew

341
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,148
he had the courage
to do what was right,

342
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,184
<i>even if it meant giving his life.</i>

343
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:15,221
Because Jeor Mormont
and Jon Snow both understood

344
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:19,659
that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

345
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,228
It's between the living and the dead.

346
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:26,299
And make no mistake, my lady,

347
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:28,368
the dead are coming.

348
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:31,705
Is this true?

349
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:36,409
Your uncle fought them
at the Fist of the First Men.

350
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,211
<i>I fought them at Hardhome.</i>

351
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,246
We both lost.

352
00:26:41,883 --> 00:26:45,452
As long as the Boltons hold
Winterfell, the North is divided.

353
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:49,356
And a divided North won't stand a
chance against the Night King.

354
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:53,994
You want to protect your people, my lady.
I understand.

355
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:55,996
<i>But there's no hiding from this.</i>

356
00:26:56,098 --> 00:27:00,100
We have to fight and we
need to do it together.

357
00:27:10,412 --> 00:27:14,781
House Mormont has kept faith with
House Stark for 1,000 years.

358
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:20,186
We will not break faith today.

359
00:27:24,926 --> 00:27:27,060
Thank you, my lady.

360
00:27:27,162 --> 00:27:30,363
How many fighting men can we expect?

361
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,304
62.

362
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,544
- 62?
- <i>We are not a large house,</i>

363
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:45,979
<i>but we're a proud one.</i>

364
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,814
And every man from Bear Island

365
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,283
fights with the strength
of 10 mainlanders.

366
00:27:50,385 --> 00:27:53,953
If they're half
as ferocious as their lady,

367
00:27:54,056 --> 00:27:56,289
the Boltons are doomed.

368
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,833
Kingslayer.

369
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:16,736
Blackfish.

370
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,805
I assume you're here

371
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,307
to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

372
00:29:21,409 --> 00:29:24,711
I don't see Sansa and Arya.

373
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:27,580
- I don't have them.
- Pity.

374
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,517
Do you wish to resume your captivity?

375
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:33,153
Then why are you here?

376
00:29:33,255 --> 00:29:34,988
You know why I'm here.

377
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,923
This castle belongs to House Frey.

378
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,558
You're trespassing.

379
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,427
In the name of King Tommen,
I order you to surrender or--

380
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,998
Or you'll kill Edmure?

381
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,834
My nephew's marked
for death no matter what.

382
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:49,369
Hang him and be done with it.

383
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:51,137
It won't stop with Edmure.

384
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:53,273
You'll force me to storm the castle.

385
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:55,175
Hundreds will die.

386
00:29:55,277 --> 00:29:58,678
Hundreds of mine.
Thousands of yours.

387
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,347
If you can breach the walls.

388
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:05,451
We'll breach them and kill
every last one of you.

389
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,122
But if you surrender,

390
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,457
I'll spare the lives of your men.

391
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,226
On my honor.

392
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:14,928
Your honor?

393
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,264
Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.

394
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:20,166
The war is over, ser.

395
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,936
Why sacrifice living men
to a lost cause?

396
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:32,745
As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.

397
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,782
This is my home.

398
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:39,752
I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.

399
00:30:39,854 --> 00:30:42,722
So you can either attack

400
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:45,525
or try to starve us out.

401
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:48,394
We have enough provisions
for two years.

402
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:53,933
Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

403
00:30:58,907 --> 00:31:02,141
You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

404
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:03,977
Why did you come treat with me?

405
00:31:05,347 --> 00:31:07,380
Sieges are dull.

406
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:10,950
And I wanted to see you in
person, get the measure of you.

407
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,586
Well, now you have.

408
00:31:13,688 --> 00:31:15,722
Aye, now I have.

409
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:18,291
I'm disappointed.

410
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:29,636
<i>The answer is no.</i>

411
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:32,872
- Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.
- I've heard enough.

412
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,675
We've only just taken back
this castle from the ironborn.

413
00:31:35,777 --> 00:31:37,777
The Boltons helped us do it.

414
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:39,712
Now you want me
to fight against them?

415
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,781
I could be skinned
for even talking to you.

416
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:44,150
The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton--

417
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:47,320
Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?

418
00:31:47,422 --> 00:31:50,290
House Mormont.

419
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,325
And?

420
00:31:52,427 --> 00:31:54,827
We sent ravens
to Houses Manderly--

421
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:57,764
I don't care about ravens.

422
00:31:57,866 --> 00:32:00,133
You're asking me to join your army.

423
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:03,569
Who is fighting in this army?

424
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,444
The bulk of the force
is made up of wildlings.

425
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,482
Then the rumors are true.

426
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,253
I didn't dare believe them.

427
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:27,026
I received you out of
respect for your father.

428
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,062
Now I would like you to leave.

429
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:32,465
House Glover will not
abandon its ancestral home

430
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:35,201
to fight alongside wildlings.

431
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:38,971
- Lord Glover.
- There's nothing else to say.

432
00:32:39,074 --> 00:32:41,140
I would remind you that House Glover

433
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:43,242
is pledged to House Stark.

434
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:46,245
Sworn to answer when called upon.

435
00:32:56,291 --> 00:33:00,426
Yes, my family served
House Stark for centuries.

436
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,329
We wept when we heard
of your father's death.

437
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:07,900
When my brother was lord of this
castle, he answered Robb's call

438
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:10,136
and hailed him King in the North.

439
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:17,410
And where was King Robb

440
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:20,680
when the ironborn
attacked this castle?

441
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:24,417
When they threw my wife
and children in prison

442
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,254
and brutalized
and killed our subjects?

443
00:33:28,356 --> 00:33:32,191
Taking up with a foreign whore.

444
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:36,162
Getting himself and those
who followed him killed.

445
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:43,369
I served House Stark once,

446
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,406
but House Stark is dead.

447
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,399
Why did we have to come here?

448
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,868
Some of us still like it.

449
00:34:53,441 --> 00:34:55,107
Have a drink at least.

450
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,509
I don't want one.

451
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,414
Don't go far, love.

452
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,583
I'll find you in a bit.

453
00:35:08,623 --> 00:35:11,991
Nothing on the Iron Islands
has an ass like that.

454
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:14,694
Doesn't interest you anymore?

455
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,766
I'm sorry.
I won't joke about it.

456
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:24,303
I'll never hurt you, little brother.

457
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:26,038
Don't you know that?

458
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,111
You think Uncle Euron's
hunting for us?

459
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,748
Of course he is. As long as
we're alive, we're a threat.

460
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,483
He'll find us.

461
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:40,286
It's a great big world
and we have fast ships.

462
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,821
Drink.

463
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:43,322
I don't want any.

464
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:45,391
I don't care what you want. Drink.

465
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:50,463
Drink it all.

466
00:35:53,034 --> 00:35:56,369
You're ironborn, Theon. I know
you've had some bad years.

467
00:35:56,471 --> 00:35:57,870
Some bad years?

468
00:35:57,972 --> 00:36:01,073
But I'm tired of watching
you cower like a beat dog.

469
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:03,442
Drink the goddamn ale.

470
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,482
Now listen to me.

471
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,917
I need you.

472
00:36:11,019 --> 00:36:14,554
The real Theon Greyjoy,
not this rat shit pretender.

473
00:36:14,656 --> 00:36:16,422
Can you find him for me?

474
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,292
Drink.

475
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,795
You escaped.
You hear me?

476
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:25,431
You got away and you're
never going back.

477
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,500
We'll get justice for you.

478
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,236
If I got justice, my burnt body would
hang over the gates of Winterfell.

479
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:32,738
Fuck justice, then.
We'll get revenge. Drink.

480
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,712
Listen to me.

481
00:36:39,814 --> 00:36:42,848
If you're so broken
that there's no coming back,

482
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,184
take a knife and cut your wrists.

483
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,688
End it.

484
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,658
But if you're staying,
Theon, I need you.

485
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,161
We're gonna sail to Meereen.

486
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,731
We're gonna make a pact
with this Dragon Queen.

487
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,634
And we're gonna take back
the Iron Islands.

488
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,339
Are you with me?

489
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,609
Are you really with me?

490
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:31,063
Now, since it's my last night
ashore for a long while,

491
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,199
I'm gonna go fuck
the tits off this one.

492
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,581
Stannis camped here
on his way to Winterfell.

493
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,017
And that's a good thing?

494
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,853
He was the most experienced
commander in Westeros.

495
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,622
He chose this place for a reason.

496
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:59,125
Those mountains are
a natural fortification.

497
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:00,960
There's a stream
down there for the horses.

498
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,895
We're not staying here long.

499
00:38:02,997 --> 00:38:04,797
Another storm could hit any day.

500
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,533
Aye, the snows defeated Stannis

501
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,568
as much as the Boltons did.

502
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:13,639
We have to march on Winterfell
now while we still can.

503
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:15,875
2,000 wildlings,

504
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,878
200 Hornwoods,
143 Mazins--

505
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,147
62 Mormonts.

506
00:38:21,249 --> 00:38:23,182
It's not what we'd hoped for.

507
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:28,554
But we still have a chance
if we're careful and smart.

508
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:32,925
For fuck's sake.

509
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:38,631
So he's your most
trusted advisor now?

510
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,934
Because he secured 62 men
from a 10-year-old?

511
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:44,637
Ser Davos is the reason I'm
standing here talking to you

512
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,906
and he served Stannis for years.

513
00:38:47,008 --> 00:38:49,642
Stannis who lost the Blackwater,

514
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,145
who murdered his own brother,
who doesn't have a head?

515
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,916
It's not enough.
We need more men.

516
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:58,784
There's no time.

517
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:01,287
If we went down to Castle
Cerwyn, I know that Lord--

518
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:03,522
We fight with the army we have.

519
00:39:06,294 --> 00:39:08,828
Friends, this is not
worth fighting over!

520
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:12,331
<i>This'll be it, now.</i>

521
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,967
Right, now we don't need
to be fighting--

522
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:16,635
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hold on.

523
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:18,471
<i>Yeah, who the fuck are you?</i>

524
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:05,184
<i>I was a soldier once.</i>

525
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:08,254
<i>All my superiors thought I was brave.</i>

526
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:11,423
<i>I wasn't. I mean, I
never ran from a fight.</i>

527
00:40:11,526 --> 00:40:15,060
Only because I was afraid my
friends would see I was afraid.

528
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,062
That's all I was, a coward.

529
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:21,033
We followed orders
no matter the orders.

530
00:40:21,135 --> 00:40:23,669
<i>Burn that village.</i>

531
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:26,105
Fine, I'm your arsonist.

532
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:28,874
Steal that farmer's crops.
Good, I'm your thief.

533
00:40:28,976 --> 00:40:32,678
Kill those young lads so they
won't take up arms against us.

534
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:35,748
I'm your murderer.

535
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:40,019
I remember once
a woman screaming at us,

536
00:40:40,121 --> 00:40:44,590
calling us animals as we dragged
her son from their hut.

537
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,859
But we weren't animals.

538
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,461
Animals are true to their nature

539
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:51,897
and we had betrayed ours.

540
00:40:54,402 --> 00:40:57,336
I cut that young boy's throat myself

541
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:59,338
as his mother screamed

542
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,373
and my friends held her back.

543
00:41:05,012 --> 00:41:06,278
That night...

544
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,616
I felt such shame.

545
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:13,619
Shame was so heavy on me,

546
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,156
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

547
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:20,025
All I could do was stare
into that dark sky

548
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:23,629
and listen to that mother
screaming her son's name.

549
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:32,037
I'll hear her screaming
the rest of my life.

550
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,277
Now, I know I can never
bring that lad back.

551
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:40,713
All I can do with time I've got left

552
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:43,148
is bring a little
goodness into the world.

553
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,317
That's all any of us
can do, isn't it?

554
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,987
Never too late
to stop robbing people,

555
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,922
<i>to stop killing people.</i>

556
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:52,892
Start helping people.

557
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,494
It's never too late to come back.

558
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,312
And it's not about waiting for
the gods to answer your prayers.

559
00:42:13,414 --> 00:42:16,782
It's not even about the gods.
It's about you.

560
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:20,152
Learning you have to answer
your prayers yourself.

561
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:25,691
Seven save you, friends.

562
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,594
<i>How can we help you?</i>

563
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:33,632
What are you doing here?

564
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:36,602
Well, we're talking about life.

565
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:37,704
You?

566
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,571
Protecting the people.

567
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:43,242
<i>Well, we thank you
for your protection.</i>

568
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:45,577
<i>Who are you protecting us from?</i>

569
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,715
Do you have any horses?

570
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,650
No horses.

571
00:42:51,752 --> 00:42:54,787
<i>No gold.
No steel.</i>

572
00:42:54,889 --> 00:42:58,524
Food, then. Protecting the
people is hungry work.

573
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:00,726
I'm sure it is.

574
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:02,227
You're welcome to stay for supper,

575
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,897
<i>but we have hungry mouths here.</i>

576
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,707
Stay safe.

577
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:16,842
The night is dark
and full of terrors.

578
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:43,736
"Seven save you,
friends."

579
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,305
I'm a fucking septon.
What was I supposed to say?

580
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:48,173
They don't believe in your Seven.

581
00:43:48,275 --> 00:43:50,576
They're from the Brotherhood.
They follow the Red God.

582
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:52,811
Aye, well, all are welcome here.

583
00:43:52,913 --> 00:43:54,680
Anyway, we got nothing for them.

584
00:43:54,782 --> 00:43:56,315
Sure, you do.
You've got food,

585
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:58,984
you've got steel even
if you say you don't.

586
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:00,452
And you've got women.

587
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,222
What do you want to do?
Fight them?

588
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:05,090
Kill them?

589
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,658
It'd be you against all of them.

590
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:09,228
I mean, these people
don't know how to fight.

591
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,529
You do.

592
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:13,265
I'm done with fighting.

593
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,367
Even if it's to protect yourself?

594
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:18,037
Violence is a disease.

595
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:21,306
You don't cure a disease by
spreading it to more people.

596
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:24,777
You don't cure it by dying, either.

597
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,447
You've done enough work for one day.

598
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:31,250
Come on up for some supper.

599
00:44:31,352 --> 00:44:33,552
It's gonna be a cold night.

600
00:44:33,654 --> 00:44:35,654
We'll need firewood.

601
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,190
I'll save you a bowl of stew.

602
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:40,292
Might even have some ale hidden away.

603
00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:50,536
He's not a lying man.

604
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:52,805
He says the Iron Fleet's
in Slaver's Bay.

605
00:44:52,907 --> 00:44:54,506
I'm inclined to believe him.

606
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,376
I'm not going anywhere
near those mad fuckers.

607
00:44:57,478 --> 00:44:59,411
You're Westerosi.

608
00:44:59,513 --> 00:45:00,946
What do you care?

609
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:03,048
I want to book passage home.

610
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,218
You? Can't afford it.

611
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:15,227
Where'd you steal this from?

612
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:17,296
Why do you care?

613
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:19,665
We leave in two days.

614
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:21,467
You can have a hammock in steerage.

615
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:25,437
<i>I want a cabin.</i>

616
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:27,473
And we'll leave at dawn.

617
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:30,609
See you at sunrise.

618
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:53,031
Sweet girl.

619
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:06,304

2
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:33,173
Despite appearances, I think you'll
find the city's on the rise.

3
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:38,279
Perhaps we should take shelter.

4
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:41,009
The city's on the rise?

5
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,551
Meereen is strong.

6
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:45,518
Commerce has returned to the markets.

7
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,055
The people are behind you.

8
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,959
Well, not all the people, of course.

9
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:55,129
No ruler that ever lived had
the support of all the people.

10
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:59,466
<i>But the rebirth of Meereen is
the cause of this violence.</i>

11
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,903
The Masters cannot
let Meereen succeed.

12
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:07,206
Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

13
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:10,477
a city without Masters...

14
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,179
...it proves that
no one needs a Master.

15
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:18,084
Good.

16
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:19,986
Shall we begin?

17
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:23,355
Do we have a plan?

18
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:25,424
I will crucify the Masters.

19
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:27,293
I will set their fleets afire,

20
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,228
kill every last one
of their soldiers,

21
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,397
and return their cities to the dirt.

22
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,800
That is my plan.

23
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:37,703
You don't approve?

24
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:40,138
You once told me you knew
what your father was.

25
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,908
Did you know his plans
for King's Landing

26
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,344
when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?

27
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:50,683
Probably not.

28
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:53,118
Well, he told my brother
and Jaime told me.

29
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,822
<i>He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,</i>

30
00:03:56,824 --> 00:03:59,457
the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,

31
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:01,459
all the major thoroughfares.

32
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,730
He would have burned
every one of his citizens.

33
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:08,165
The loyal ones and the traitors.

34
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,601
Every man, woman, and child.

35
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:12,102
That's why Jaime killed him.

36
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:13,504
This is entirely different.

37
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,640
You're talking about
destroying cities.

38
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,742
It's not entirely different.

39
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,082
I'd like to suggest
an alternate approach.

40
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,097
Once before, I offered you peace.

41
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:43,567
If you had not been so arrogant,

42
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,504
you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

43
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:53,610
Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot

44
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:55,979
like the beggar queen you are.

45
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:59,115
<i>We are here to
discuss terms of surrender,</i>

46
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:01,584
not to trade insults.

47
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:03,619
The terms are simple.

48
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:07,223
You and your foreign friends
will abandon the Great Pyramid

49
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:08,724
<i>and the city of Meereen.</i>

50
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,327
<i>The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz</i>

51
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:14,329
<i>will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.</i>

52
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:17,466
<i>The translator you stole from
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain</i>

53
00:05:17,468 --> 00:05:19,935
to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

54
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:23,806
The dragons beneath the Great
Pyramid will be slaughtered.

55
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:27,877
We obviously didn't
communicate clearly.

56
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,745
We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

57
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:36,651
I imagine it's difficult

58
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,254
adjusting to the new reality.

59
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,893
Your reign is over.

60
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:50,364
My reign has just begun.

61
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:29,486
Dracarys.

62
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,052
_

63
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:23,205
_

64
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:26,089
_

65
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:35,316
Thank you for the armada.

66
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:37,185
<i>Our queen does love ships.</i>

67
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:42,356
Now, last time we spoke,
we made a pact.

68
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:44,558
You violated that pact.

69
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,326
You declared war upon us.

70
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,696
<i>Though our queen does have
a forgiving nature,</i>

71
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:51,999
this cannot be forgiven.

72
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:54,968
Our queen insists
that one of you must die

73
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,371
<i>as punishment for your crimes.</i>

74
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,042
It always seems a bit
abstract, doesn't it,

75
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:03,843
other people dying?

76
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,814
Him.
He should die.

77
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,184
<i>- Yes, him.
- He's not one of us.</i>

78
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:11,818
<i>He's an outsider, a lowborn.</i>

79
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,853
<i>He does not speak for us.</i>

80
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:18,992
Please.

81
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,195
Please.

82
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:43,216
Tell your people what happened here.

83
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:48,153
Tell them you live
by the grace of Her Majesty.

84
00:10:48,155 --> 00:10:50,355
When they come forward
with notions of retribution

85
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:54,860
or ideas about returning the slave
cities to their former glory,

86
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,062
remind them what happened

87
00:10:57,064 --> 00:11:00,732
when Daenerys Stormborn and
her dragons came to Meereen.

88
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:38,602
You don't have to be here.

89
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:40,671
Yes, I do.

90
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,363
My beloved wife.

91
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,801
I've missed you terribly.

92
00:12:15,206 --> 00:12:18,474
Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

93
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:21,277
Now, dismount and kneel before me,

94
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,613
surrender your army and proclaim
me the true Lord of Winterfell

95
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:26,381
and Warden of the North.

96
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:28,450
I will pardon you for
deserting the Night's Watch.

97
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:32,454
I will pardon these treasonous
lords for betraying my house.

98
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:38,160
Come, bastard,

99
00:12:38,162 --> 00:12:41,062
you don't have the men,
you don't have the horses,

100
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,365
<i>and you don't have Winterfell.</i>

101
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:47,101
<i>Why lead those poor souls
into slaughter?</i>

102
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,871
There's no need for a battle.

103
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:52,841
Get off your horse and kneel.

104
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:56,544
I'm a man of mercy.

105
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,351
You're right.

106
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:05,486
There's no need for a battle.

107
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:09,657
Thousands of men don't need to die.

108
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,361
Only one of us.

109
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,798
Let's end this the old way.

110
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,900
You against me.

111
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:35,249
I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

112
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:37,517
The way people in the
North talk about you,

113
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,786
you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

114
00:13:40,956 --> 00:13:43,357
Maybe you are that good.

115
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:45,592
Maybe not.

116
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:48,227
<i>I don't know if I'd beat you.</i>

117
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:51,498
But I know that my army
will beat yours.

118
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,666
<i>I have 6,000 men.</i>

119
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:57,169
You have, what, half that?

120
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:58,671
Not even?

121
00:13:58,673 --> 00:14:00,707
Aye, you have the numbers.

122
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,742
Will your men want to fight for you

123
00:14:03,744 --> 00:14:06,645
when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

124
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:17,323
He's good.
Very good.

125
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,460
Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

126
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:23,762
because you're too proud
to surrender?

127
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,731
How do we know you have him?

128
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,924
<i>Now, if you want
to save--</i>

129
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,493
You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

130
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,498
Sleep well.

131
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,675
She's a fine woman, your sister.

132
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,778
<i>I look forward to having
her back in my bed.</i>

133
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,784
And you're all
fine-looking men.

134
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,053
My dogs are desperate to meet you.

135
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,788
I haven't fed them for seven days.

136
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,189
They're ravenous.

137
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,325
I wonder which parts
they'll try first.

138
00:15:29,327 --> 00:15:31,828
<i>Your eyes?</i>

139
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,296
Your balls?

140
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,001
We'll find out soon enough.

141
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:42,338
In the morning, then, bastard.

142
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,590
<i>If he was smart, he'd stay inside</i>

143
00:16:01,592 --> 00:16:03,458
<i>the walls of Winterfell
and wait us out.</i>

144
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,529
That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

145
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,464
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

146
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,266
they'll stop fearing him.

147
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:14,036
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

148
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,738
It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

149
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,441
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

150
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:21,843
It's not his men that worry me.

151
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:23,278
It's his horses.

152
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,547
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

153
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,783
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

154
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:31,118
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

155
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,421
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

156
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:34,756
in a double envelopment.

157
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,628
A pincer move.

158
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:48,135
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

159
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,037
Good.

160
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:55,276
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

161
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,280
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

162
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:05,218
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

163
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,789
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

164
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,593
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

165
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,328
No.

166
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,230
But I wanted to make him angry.

167
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,268
I want him coming at us full tilt.

168
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,106
We should all get some sleep.

169
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:29,942
<i>Rest, Jon Snow. We
need you sharp tomorrow.</i>

170
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:42,855
So you've met the enemy,

171
00:17:42,857 --> 00:17:46,358
drawn up your battle plans.

172
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,361
Aye, for what they're worth.

173
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:53,332
You've known him for the space
of a single conversation,

174
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:55,266
you and your trusted advisors,

175
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:56,935
<i>and you sit around making your plans</i>

176
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,904
<i>on how to defeat
a man you don't know.</i>

177
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:01,506
<i>I lived with him.</i>

178
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:03,241
I know the way his mind works.

179
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:06,410
I know how he likes to hurt people.

180
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:10,681
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

181
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,885
You're right.

182
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,622
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

183
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,990
He won't. He's the
one who lays traps.

184
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,893
- <i>He's overconfident.</i>
- He plays with people.

185
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,630
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

186
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:28,565
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

187
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:32,469
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

188
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:35,305
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

189
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:37,875
You don't know him.

190
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:41,178
All right, tell me.

191
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,047
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

192
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,750
We'll never get him back.

193
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,255
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

194
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,090
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

195
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,260
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

196
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,296
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

197
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,900
which means he won't live long.

198
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:06,368
We can't give up on our brother.

199
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,538
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

200
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,709
Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

201
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,877
I don't know. I don't know
anything about battles.

202
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:18,380
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

203
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:19,682
Aye, that's good advice.

204
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,183
You think that's obvious?

205
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:22,618
Well, it is a bit obvious.

206
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,985
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

207
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:25,754
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

208
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:28,190
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

209
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,559
When will we have a larger force?

210
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:32,728
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

211
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,062
The Blackfish can't help us.

212
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:36,131
We're lucky to have this many men.

213
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,634
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

214
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:47,976
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

215
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,284
If Ramsay wins,

216
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,319
I'm not going back there alive.

217
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,987
Do you understand me?

218
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:06,493
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

219
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:11,498
I'll protect you, I promise.

220
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:15,335
No one can protect me.

221
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:17,238
No one can protect anyone.

222
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:38,057
<i>You think there's hope?</i>

223
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:40,493
I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

224
00:20:40,495 --> 00:20:42,962
And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

225
00:20:42,964 --> 00:20:44,964
so, yes, there's hope.

226
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:50,770
You want to avenge
your king, don't you?

227
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:53,673
It wasn't the Boltons
defeated Stannis.

228
00:20:53,675 --> 00:20:56,275
It was Stannis himself.

229
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:58,010
I loved the man.

230
00:20:58,012 --> 00:21:00,546
He lifted me up
and made me something.

231
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:03,783
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

232
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:06,385
- You saw these demons?
- What?

233
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:09,855
No, it's a manner of speaking.

234
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,726
Not actual demons.

235
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:16,161
Oh.

236
00:21:16,163 --> 00:21:19,231
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis

237
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:21,466
and I loved the man he burned.

238
00:21:21,468 --> 00:21:23,568
Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

239
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,172
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

240
00:21:27,174 --> 00:21:29,641
I believed in him.

241
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:33,712
I thought he was the man to
lead us through the Long Night.

242
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:35,980
But I was wrong just like you.

243
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:41,052
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

244
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:45,189
Jon Snow's not a king.

245
00:21:46,926 --> 00:21:48,726
No, he's not.

246
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:55,933
<i>I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight.</i>

247
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,501
You want some?

248
00:21:57,503 --> 00:22:00,004
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

249
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,072
stronger than any of that grape water

250
00:22:02,074 --> 00:22:04,341
you southern twats like sucking on.

251
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:06,276
No, thanks.
It does sound delicious,

252
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:08,979
but I better keep a clear head.

253
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:11,382
I can never sleep
the night before a battle.

254
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:13,183
So what do you do all night?

255
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:15,452
I walk.

256
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:17,320
Think and walk.

257
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:19,522
Think and walk until I'm
far enough away from camp

258
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:21,724
that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

259
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:25,728
Happy shitting.

260
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,075
My lady.

261
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:46,982
You weren't at the war council.

262
00:22:48,486 --> 00:22:50,420
I'm not a soldier.

263
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:53,923
Any advice?

264
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:56,258
Don't lose.

265
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,133
If I do, if I fall...

266
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:09,270
don't bring me back.

267
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:11,306
I'll have to try.

268
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,508
I'm ordering you
not to bring me back.

269
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,243
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

270
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,646
You're in my camp.
I'm the commander.

271
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,415
I serve the Lord of Light.

272
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,751
I do what he commands.

273
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:24,185
How do you know what he commands?

274
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:29,023
I interpret his signs

275
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:31,192
as well as I can.

276
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:36,197
If the Lord didn't
want me to bring you back,

277
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,866
how did I bring you back?

278
00:23:38,868 --> 00:23:41,502
I have no power.

279
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,872
Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

280
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,609
Why?

281
00:23:48,611 --> 00:23:50,778
I don't know.

282
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:59,987
Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

283
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:02,990
Maybe he brought you here
to die again.

284
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,230
What kind of god would do
something like that?

285
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:14,300
The one we've got.

286
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:07,310
Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

287
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:13,649
You were making jokes about
my height, I seem to recall.

288
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:18,053
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

289
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:21,991
thinks he's the only person ever to
make a joke about a dwarf's height.

290
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:25,428
"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

291
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,262
"someone to look up to."

292
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,766
You're all making the same
five or six jokes.

293
00:26:30,768 --> 00:26:34,136
- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

294
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:37,506
And how have things been
going for you since then?

295
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,408
Not so well, I gather.

296
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,011
Can't imagine you would
have murdered the Stark boys

297
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:44,346
if things had been going well.

298
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:46,047
I didn't murder the Stark boys.

299
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:48,983
But I did things that were
just as bad or worse.

300
00:26:48,985 --> 00:26:50,318
And he paid for them.

301
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,387
Doesn't seem like it.

302
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:54,322
He's still alive.

303
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:56,391
It was complicated for you, I'm sure,

304
00:26:56,393 --> 00:26:58,660
growing up at Winterfell.

305
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:01,929
Never quite knowing who you were.

306
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:05,566
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

307
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:07,635
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

308
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:09,370
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

309
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:11,673
In return, I expect
you want me to support

310
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:14,208
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

311
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,210
Not my claim.
Hers.

312
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:18,312
And what's wrong with you?

313
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,880
I'm not fit to rule.

314
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:21,582
We can agree upon that at least.

315
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:24,251
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

316
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:25,852
No more than Westeros.

317
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:31,058
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

318
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,694
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

319
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,263
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

320
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,900
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

321
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:44,036
You and I have that in common.

322
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,905
We do.

323
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:49,242
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

324
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,244
Will their ships be enough?

325
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:55,380
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

326
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,515
Barely.

327
00:27:57,517 --> 00:28:00,318
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

328
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,821
There are and Euron is building more.

329
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:04,556
He's going to offer them to you.

330
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,058
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

331
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,727
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

332
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,928
He also wants
to give you--

333
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,666
His big cock, I think he said.

334
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:18,002
<i>Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.</i>

335
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:19,871
<i>You won't get one without the other.</i>

336
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:22,507
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

337
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:25,810
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

338
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:30,414
<i>He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.</i>

339
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:33,084
<i>He'll murder you as soon
as you have what he wants.</i>

340
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,819
The Seven Kingdoms.

341
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,120
All of them.

342
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:37,889
And you don't want
the Seven Kingdoms?

343
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:41,258
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

344
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,860
We ask you to give them back.

345
00:28:43,862 --> 00:28:45,228
And that's all?

346
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,864
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

347
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:49,833
who don't think
a woman's fit to rule.

348
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:51,502
Reasonable.

349
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:56,472
What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

350
00:28:56,474 --> 00:28:58,608
She's not demanding, she's asking.

351
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,377
The others are free to ask as well.

352
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:08,685
Our fathers were evil men,
all of us here.

353
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:11,254
They left the world
worse than they found it.

354
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:12,922
<i>We're not going to do that.</i>

355
00:29:12,924 --> 00:29:15,958
We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

356
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:21,564
You will support my claim as
queen of the Seven Kingdoms

357
00:29:21,566 --> 00:29:24,967
and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

358
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:29,538
No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

359
00:29:30,875 --> 00:29:32,441
That's our way of life.

360
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:33,976
No more.

361
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:43,252
No more.

362
00:33:27,804 --> 00:33:30,505
Do you like games, little man?

363
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:32,574
Let's play a game.

364
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:37,979
Run to your brother.

365
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:39,914
The sooner you make it to him,

366
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,316
the sooner you get to see him again.

367
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,554
That's it.

368
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:48,790
That's the game.

369
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,792
Easy.

370
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:52,794
Ready?

371
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:54,061
Go.

372
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:01,102
No, you have to run, remember?

373
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:03,270
Those are the rules.

374
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:18,151
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

375
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,611
Hyah! Hyah!

376
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:03,286
Don't.

377
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:15,398
Prepare to charge.

378
00:36:17,502 --> 00:36:18,868
Prepare to charge.

379
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:23,272
<i>- Draw!
- Draw!</i>

380
00:36:23,274 --> 00:36:25,474
<i>Draw!</i>

381
00:36:25,476 --> 00:36:26,943
<i>Loose!</i>

382
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,780
Hyah! Hyah!

383
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:36,919
Go! Go!
Follow your commander!

384
00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:43,859
Run and fight!

385
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:11,886
Hyah!

386
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:14,656
<i>Nock!</i>

387
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:17,158
<i>- Draw!

389
00:37:28,271 --> 00:37:29,603
Now.

390
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:33,940
<i>Cavalry, charge!</i>

391
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:29,728
- Nock!
<i>- Nock!</i>

392
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,230

<i>- Draw!</i>

395
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:44,075
We'll just kill our own men.
Stand down.

396
00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:46,844
- Loose!
- Loose!

397
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:28,952
Get word--

398
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:50,072
<i>No!</i>

399
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,320
Loose!

400
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:22,971
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

401
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:32,613
- Loose!
<i>- Loose!</i>

402
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:04,978
We may as well be
taking shits back here.

403
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,181
Follow!

404
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:16,823
It's time, go.

405
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:21,394
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

406
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:24,230
- Who owns the North?
- We do!

407
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:25,864
Show me!

408
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:56,762
Hey!

409
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,054
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

410
00:43:29,987 --> 00:43:32,855
With me, lads!
Break their line!

411
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:07,855
Help me!

412
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:38,218
- Tormund!
- Get him back!

413
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,954
<i>Infantry, advance.</i>

414
00:44:46,228 --> 00:44:48,728
<i>Both sides!</i>

415
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,663
<i>Fall back!</i>

416
00:44:50,665 --> 00:44:53,766
<i>Fall back!</i>

417
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:16,155
Fuck this, come on!

418
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,166
We're going home!

419
00:49:44,483 --> 00:49:46,649
<i>Open the gate!</i>

420
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,856
<i>Archers to the wall.</i>

421
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:58,093
- Their army's gone.
- Our army's gone.

422
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,363
We have Winterfell.

423
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,932
They don't have the men for a siege.
All we have to do is wait.

424
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,834
<i>Archers!</i>

425
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,536
To the wall!

426
00:51:41,696 --> 00:51:44,597
You suggested one-on-one
combat, didn't you?

427
00:51:52,306 --> 00:51:54,906
I've reconsidered.

428
00:51:54,908 --> 00:51:58,377
I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

429
00:53:58,262 --> 00:54:00,995
We're going to bury
my brother in the crypt

430
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:03,097
next to my father.

431
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:10,505
Jon.

432
00:54:16,112 --> 00:54:18,279
Where is he?

433
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,241
Ah.

434
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,810
Sansa.

435
00:54:53,282 --> 00:54:55,481
Hello, Sansa.

436
00:55:02,824 --> 00:55:05,491
Is this where I'll be staying now?

437
00:55:13,868 --> 00:55:15,901
No.

438
00:55:19,673 --> 00:55:23,475
Our time together is
about to come to an end.

439
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,914
<i>That's all right.</i>

440
00:55:28,916 --> 00:55:30,749
You can't kill me.

441
00:55:32,353 --> 00:55:34,519
I'm part of you now.

442
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,591
Your words will disappear.

443
00:55:42,262 --> 00:55:45,129
Your house will disappear.

444
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:48,333
<i>Your name will disappear.</i>

445
00:55:50,303 --> 00:55:52,904
<i>All memory of you will disappear.</i>

446
00:56:19,965 --> 00:56:22,733
My hounds will never harm me.

447
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:25,235
You haven't fed them in seven days.

448
00:56:25,237 --> 00:56:26,736
You said it yourself.

449
00:56:30,943 --> 00:56:32,675
They're loyal beasts.

450
00:56:32,677 --> 00:56:34,577
<i>They were.</i>

451
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:36,479
Now they're starving.

452
00:57:00,504 --> 00:57:02,471
Sit.

453
00:57:02,473 --> 00:57:04,006
Down.

454
00:57:04,008 --> 00:57:06,608
Down!

455
00:57:07,678 --> 00:57:09,979
Down! Down!

456
00:57:09,981 --> 00:57:11,914
Down!

457
00:57:53,923 --> 00:58:04,101

2
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:19,470
<i>Your Grace.</i>

3
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:23,207
The trial will be
getting under way soon.

4
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:57,041
You got my money?

5
00:04:57,143 --> 00:04:59,443
Later.
Go away.

6
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:12,556
Grand Maester.

7
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:55,432
Ser Loras Tyrell.

8
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,004
Are you prepared to stand trial

9
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:03,807
and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

10
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:08,812
There'll be no need for a trial.

11
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,717
I confess before the Seven

12
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,819
and freely admit to my crimes.

13
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:20,057
To which crimes
will you be confessing?

14
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,493
All of them.

15
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,930
I lay with other men

16
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:29,466
including the traitor
Renly Baratheon.

17
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:35,739
<i>I perjured myself before the gods.</i>

18
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:38,142
I am guilty of depravity...

19
00:06:39,645 --> 00:06:41,645
dishonesty,

20
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,214
profligacy,

21
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:46,183
<i>and arrogance.</i>

22
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:47,718
I see that now.

23
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:52,323
I humble myself before the Seven

24
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:55,826
and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

25
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:02,733
The gods' judgment is fierce,

26
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:05,369
but also fair.

27
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,839
The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

28
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:11,208
beyond the reach of justice.

29
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:15,779
But the Mother shows her mercy

30
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:19,683
to those who kneel before her.

31
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,427
<i>I take full
responsibility for my many sins</i>

32
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,030
and unburden myself of my desires.

33
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,436
My only remaining wish

34
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:42,139
is to devote my life to the Seven.

35
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:45,309
<i>May I be a living example
of their grace</i>

36
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:48,078
<i>for others to witness.</i>

37
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:53,117
You understand fully

38
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,052
what this means?

39
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:56,654
I do.

40
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,358
I will abandon the Tyrell name

41
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,495
and all that goes with it.

42
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:08,365
I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

43
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:14,238
I will never marry

44
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,740
and I will never father children.

45
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:22,279
<i>Brother Loras...</i>

46
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:27,151
...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

47
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,191
Will you fight to defend your faith

48
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:36,727
against heretics and apostates?

49
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,329
I will.

50
00:09:07,526 --> 00:09:08,692
No, I can't let them--

51
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:11,762
Faith is the way, Father.

52
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,486
All right.

53
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,422
I'm ready.

54
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:48,365
I have to go.
I'm--

55
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,401
I'm late for the trial.

56
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,649
<i>You mutilated him.</i>

57
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:07,651
You gave me your word.

58
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:10,120
And I have kept my word.

59
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:12,990
<i>Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,</i>

60
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,125
<i>Brother Loras is free to leave.</i>

61
00:10:15,227 --> 00:10:17,127
And where is the queen mother?

62
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:20,497
Her litter never left the Red Keep.

63
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:24,535
It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

64
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,606
Go to the Red Keep
and show her the way.

65
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:58,235
Get the others.

66
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,212
Where's the king?

67
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,117
Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

68
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:48,852
What's the meaning of this?

69
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,821
I was told that--

70
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:52,389
ah.

71
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,591
I have more important
things to do with my time

72
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:56,059
than waste them
in the presence--

73
00:11:56,161 --> 00:11:58,829
Please, Grand Maester.
I bear you no ill will.

74
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,633
Please forgive me if you can.

75
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,533
This pains me, my lord.

76
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:38,702
Whatever your faults,
you do not deserve

77
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:41,772
to die alone in such
a cold, dark place.

78
00:12:41,874 --> 00:12:45,609
But sometimes before
we can usher in the new,

79
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:49,846
the old must be put to rest.

80
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:34,124
The longer you wait,
the worse it'll be for you.

81
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:03,120
What are you doing?

82
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:12,556
There's something wrong.

83
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:15,125
You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

84
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:17,094
The trial will begin shortly.

85
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,896
Cersei is not here.
Tommen is not here.

86
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:21,358
Why do you think they're not here?

87
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,266
If the accused is not here,

88
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:25,435
she will be tried regardless.

89
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:27,771
We cannot escape
the justice of the gods--

90
00:15:27,873 --> 00:15:30,507
Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you.

91
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:34,044
Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

92
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:35,912
and she is absent anyway,

93
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:39,883
which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

94
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:43,854
The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

95
00:16:09,648 --> 00:16:11,748
We all need to leave now.

96
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:19,156
Loras.

97
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,424
Stay with me.

98
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:36,673
Let me through.
Let me through.

99
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:40,844
<i>Get out of my way.</i>

100
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:51,087
Let us through.

101
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,579
<i>Confess.</i>

102
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,716
<i>Confess.</i>

103
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:33,056
- No.
- Confess.

104
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,502
Confess.
It felt good.

105
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:49,306
Beating me, starving me,

106
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:52,309
frightening me, humiliating me.

107
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:58,081
<i>You didn't do it because
you cared about my atonement.</i>

108
00:18:58,183 --> 00:19:01,318
You did it because it felt good.

109
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,653
<i>I understand.</i>

110
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:06,923
I do things because they feel good.

111
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:13,229
I drink because it feels good.

112
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:17,434
I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

113
00:19:20,772 --> 00:19:25,742
I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

114
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:27,911
I lie about fucking my brother...

115
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:33,950
because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

116
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,521
I killed your High Sparrow...

117
00:19:40,492 --> 00:19:42,659
<i>and all his little sparrows...</i>

118
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:47,597
all his septons, all his septas,

119
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:50,533
all his filthy soldiers,

120
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:53,837
because it felt good
to watch them burn.

121
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:59,509
It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

122
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:02,946
No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

123
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:12,155
Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

124
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,363
You've always been quiet.

125
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,307
I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

126
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:33,476
Do you remember?

127
00:20:33,578 --> 00:20:35,545
Good.

128
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:40,083
I'm glad to see your face.

129
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:44,921
I'm ready to meet the gods.

130
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,356
What?

131
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,293
Now?

132
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:51,861
Today?

133
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,367
You're not going to die today.

134
00:20:59,871 --> 00:21:02,338
You're not going to die
for quite a while.

135
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,743
Ser Gregor.

136
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:13,049
<i>This is Ser Gregor Clegane.</i>

137
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,752
He's quiet, too.

138
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,498
Your gods have forsaken you.

139
00:21:29,734 --> 00:21:31,868
This is your god now.

140
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:44,881
No.

141
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:47,150
No.

142
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:51,921
Shame.

143
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:55,258
Shame.

144
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,062
Shame.

145
00:22:03,969 --> 00:22:06,469
<i>I'm very sorry, Your Grace.</i>

146
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:09,772
Very sorry.

147
00:22:53,552 --> 00:22:55,919
<i>For House Lannister!</i>

148
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:57,954
<i>Hear me roar!</i>

149
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:05,795
For House Frey!

150
00:23:05,897 --> 00:23:08,965
We stand together!

151
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:11,935
May we stand together
through the centuries,

152
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,504
good friends to the last.

153
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:18,641
And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

154
00:23:18,743 --> 00:23:22,545
may we speak the words
of our alliance,

155
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:26,049
"The Freys and the Lannisters

156
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,351
send their regards."

157
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,171
You don't even have
to do anything, do you?

158
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:51,841
You just sit there,
a rich slab of beef,

159
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:53,376
and all the birds come pecking.

160
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:55,878
- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

161
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:58,381
She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

162
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:02,352
Those two have their eyes on you.

163
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:06,222
They have their eyes on you, cunt.

164
00:24:06,324 --> 00:24:08,124
Not my type.

165
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:09,792
Not blonde enough?

166
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:15,698
Ladies, have you met
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

167
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,967
hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

168
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:20,436
- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

169
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:25,241
Fuck it.

170
00:24:25,343 --> 00:24:28,511
No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

171
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:36,252
This came together rather well.

172
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,156
Your father would be pleased.

173
00:24:40,258 --> 00:24:41,924
I'm sure he would be.

174
00:24:44,562 --> 00:24:47,397
Edmure is back in a cell.

175
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:51,134
Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

176
00:24:51,236 --> 00:24:53,403
Give the family a bad name.

177
00:24:56,875 --> 00:25:00,810
So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

178
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,813
Legendary warrior, everyone said.

179
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:07,583
Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

180
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:10,219
I'm a bit old for all that.

181
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:13,022
No, but back in your day.

182
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:16,059
The purpose of fighting

183
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:19,362
is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

184
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,464
I've defeated mine.

185
00:25:21,566 --> 00:25:25,268
Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

186
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,936
Now it's mine.

187
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,339
What do you call that?

188
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:30,707
Victory.

189
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,309
Yes, you're a great conqueror.

190
00:25:34,913 --> 00:25:38,681
Go on, mock me, boy.
You think I mind?

191
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:41,517
The Tullys mocked me for years.

192
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,786
The Starks mocked me.

193
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:45,355
Where are they now?

194
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:47,924
<i>You talk about war
as if you're an expert,</i>

195
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:50,326
but the one battle
I remember you fighting,

196
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:53,329
you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

197
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:56,332
<i>But it doesn't matter.</i>

198
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:59,769
Here we are now, two kingslayers.

199
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:03,740
We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

200
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:06,843
and snigger behind our backs.

201
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,511
We don't mind, do we?

202
00:26:08,613 --> 00:26:12,582
Fear is a marvelous thing.

203
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:14,283
They don't fear the Freys, though.

204
00:26:14,386 --> 00:26:17,120
They fear the Lannisters.

205
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:19,589
We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

206
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:22,125
If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

207
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:24,627
every time you lose them,

208
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:26,696
why do we need you?

209
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:50,052
Show me.

210
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:54,824
Your Grace,
there's no need--

211
00:26:54,926 --> 00:26:56,292
Show me.

212
00:27:09,207 --> 00:27:12,608
What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

213
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:15,378
As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

214
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,248
<i>perhaps a ceremony
in the throne room?</i>

215
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,853
He should be with his grandfather,

216
00:27:23,955 --> 00:27:26,789
his brother, his sister.

217
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:31,894
Burn him

218
00:27:31,996 --> 00:27:34,964
and bury his ashes
where the sept once stood.

219
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:49,912
Whoa, whoa.

220
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,056
Hello.

221
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,534
From Lord Commander Snow
at Castle Black.

222
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,417
I'm--

223
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:03,019
I'm to be the new maester.

224
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:19,502
Oh.

225
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:22,004
According to our records,

226
00:29:22,106 --> 00:29:23,873
Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

227
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:27,009
He died.

228
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:29,679
We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

229
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:32,915
Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

230
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:35,284
He's since passed away.

231
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:39,422
Which is why I'm here.

232
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:44,627
This is irregular.

233
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:49,398
Yes, well, I suppose
that life is irregular.

234
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:05,081
The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

235
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:10,686
In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

236
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:12,655
Follow me.

237
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:17,627
No women or children.

238
00:32:11,876 --> 00:32:14,176
When we had feasts,

239
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:16,545
our family would sit up here...

240
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:20,449
and I'd sit down there.

241
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:25,354
Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

242
00:32:25,456 --> 00:32:27,223
You had a family.

243
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:28,491
You had feasts.

244
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:33,796
Aye, you're right.
I was luckier than most.

245
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:50,913
What is that?

246
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,483
Tell him.

247
00:32:57,522 --> 00:32:59,722
<i>Tell him who it belonged to.</i>

248
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,195
The Princess Shireen.

249
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:08,597
Tell him what you did to her.

250
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:11,767
Tell him!

251
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:20,176
We burned her at the stake.

252
00:33:33,324 --> 00:33:35,658
Why?

253
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,861
The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

254
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:42,031
- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

255
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,566
I only do what my Lord commands.

256
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:46,802
If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

257
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:51,807
We are standing here because of him.

258
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:56,579
<i>Jon Snow is alive
because the Lord willed it.</i>

259
00:33:56,681 --> 00:34:00,282
I loved that girl
like she was my own.

260
00:34:00,384 --> 00:34:03,686
She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

261
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,356
So did her father.

262
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,126
So did her mother.

263
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,564
<i>Her own blood knew
it was the only way.</i>

264
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:18,267
The only way for what?

265
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:19,869
They all died anyway.

266
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,739
You told everyone
Stannis was the one.

267
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:26,175
You had him believing it,
all of them fooled.

268
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:28,744
- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

269
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:31,814
I was wrong.

270
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:35,150
<i>Aye, you were wrong.</i>

271
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:38,888
How many died because you were wrong?

272
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:47,763
I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

273
00:34:47,865 --> 00:34:49,665
<i>She admits to the crime.</i>

274
00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:54,570
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

275
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,174
I've been ready
to die for many years.

276
00:35:00,978 --> 00:35:04,013
If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

277
00:35:04,115 --> 00:35:07,316
You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

278
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:10,686
You know the great war
is still to come.

279
00:35:10,788 --> 00:35:13,756
You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

280
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:17,559
And you know I can
help you win that war.

281
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:33,709
Ride south today.

282
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,112
If you return to the North,

283
00:35:37,214 --> 00:35:39,815
I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

284
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,169
If you ever come back this way,

285
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,638
I will execute you myself.

286
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:37,439
I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

287
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:41,210
Mother and Father's room?

288
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,513
You should take it.

289
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:47,883
I'm not a Stark.

290
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:50,386
You are to me.

291
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:55,724
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

292
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:59,728
You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

293
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,332
<i>The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.</i>

294
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,634
They came because of you.

295
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,574
You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

296
00:37:12,676 --> 00:37:14,443
- He did.
- And you trust him?

297
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:18,180
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

298
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:24,086
I should have told you about him,

299
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:27,523
about the Knights of the Vale.

300
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,091
I'm sorry.

301
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:42,371
We need to trust each other.

302
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:45,474
We can't fight a war
amongst ourselves.

303
00:37:45,576 --> 00:37:48,077
We have so many enemies now.

304
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:06,361
Jon.

305
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:09,898
A raven came from the Citadel.

306
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,900
A white raven.

307
00:38:14,605 --> 00:38:16,138
Winter is here.

308
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:31,553
Well, Father always
promised, didn't he?

309
00:38:45,636 --> 00:38:48,804
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

310
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:51,006
he was assassinated.

311
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:53,675
100 red scorpions, was it?

312
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:56,278
You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

313
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,514
You murder your own prince,

314
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,349
but you expect me to trust you?

315
00:39:00,451 --> 00:39:03,418
We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

316
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,787
You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

317
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,390
What is your name again?

318
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:09,858
Barbaro?

319
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,560
Obara.

320
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:14,796
Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

321
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:17,533
<i>Don't presume to tell me what I need.</i>

322
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:20,969
Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes--

323
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:24,573
Do shut up, dear.
Anything from you?

324
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:26,575
No? Good.

325
00:39:26,677 --> 00:39:29,077
Let the grown women speak.

326
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,881
The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

327
00:39:32,983 --> 00:39:35,951
They have declared war on Dorne.

328
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:39,688
We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

329
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:43,959
Cersei stole the future from me.

330
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:45,827
She killed my son.

331
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,963
<i>She killed my grandson.</i>

332
00:39:48,065 --> 00:39:51,266
She killed my granddaughter.

333
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:54,203
Survival is not what I'm after now.

334
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:56,471
You're absolutely right.

335
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:59,141
I chose the wrong words.

336
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:01,743
It is not survival I offer.

337
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:04,179
It is your heart's desire.

338
00:40:06,016 --> 00:40:09,218
And what is my heart's desire?

339
00:40:10,788 --> 00:40:13,021
Vengeance.

340
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:14,223
Justice.

341
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:19,828
Fire and blood.

342
00:40:26,303 --> 00:40:29,104
Your ships are nearly ready.

343
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:31,506
I saw them painting the sails.

344
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:38,747
I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

345
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:40,749
You're not coming with us.

346
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,355
New strategy?

347
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:49,658
You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

348
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,361
If we take Casterly Rock,

349
00:40:52,463 --> 00:40:56,031
the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

350
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:58,066
You're not going to Westeros.

351
00:40:58,168 --> 00:41:01,103
You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

352
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,839
There's finally peace in Meereen.

353
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:07,276
You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

354
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,379
Fuck Meereen.

355
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,381
Fuck the people.

356
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:14,750
I'm here for you, not them.

357
00:41:14,852 --> 00:41:16,518
You promised me.

358
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,554
"My sword is yours.
My life is yours."

359
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:22,758
<i>This is what I command.</i>

360
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,861
If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

361
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,463
I'll need to make alliances.

362
00:41:28,565 --> 00:41:31,933
The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

363
00:41:35,272 --> 00:41:37,105
Who are you marrying this time?

364
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:40,575
I don't know.
Maybe no one.

365
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:43,779
But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

366
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:45,847
Are you a queen or fish bait?

367
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:51,253
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

368
00:41:51,355 --> 00:41:53,588
A king wouldn't think twice about it.

369
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:56,591
So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

370
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:59,995
I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

371
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:02,197
sits beside you in the throne room.

372
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:05,334
I don't want a crown.
I want you.

373
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:14,509
I love you.

374
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:17,079
And I make you happy.

375
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:19,047
You know I do.

376
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:24,986
Bring me with you.
Let me fight for you.

377
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:33,862
I can't.

378
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,340
The dwarf told you to do this?

379
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:47,109
<i>No one tells me to do anything.</i>

380
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:50,379
Clever fellow.
Can't argue with his logic.

381
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:52,214
I'm no use to you over there.

382
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:53,582
Don't get angry.

383
00:42:53,684 --> 00:42:56,852
I'm not angry.
I'm full of self-pity.

384
00:42:56,954 --> 00:42:58,553
Who comes after you?

385
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:01,823
Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

386
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:04,192
A great number of women, I imagine.

387
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,234
Specific orders will be left for you

388
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:15,270
regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

389
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:17,172
Bay of Dragons?

390
00:43:17,274 --> 00:43:20,275
We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

391
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,581
You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

392
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:30,118
I hope it brings you happiness.

393
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:37,793
I pity the lords of Westeros.

394
00:43:37,895 --> 00:43:40,061
They have no idea
what's coming for them.

395
00:43:40,164 --> 00:43:44,099
Farewell, Daario Naharis.

396
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:05,086
How did he take it?

397
00:44:05,189 --> 00:44:07,255
No tears.

398
00:44:09,326 --> 00:44:11,960
I know it was hard for you.

399
00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:14,095
You turned away a man
who truly loves you

400
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:17,098
because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

401
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,371
That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

402
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:25,640
if it's any consolation.

403
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:30,345
It's not.

404
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:32,747
No, I suppose not.

405
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,382
I'm terrible at consoling.

406
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:36,785
Yes, you really are.

407
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:44,159
All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

408
00:44:45,662 --> 00:44:48,530
You have your armies,
you have your ships,

409
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,632
you have your dragons.

410
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,701
Everything you've ever wanted

411
00:44:52,803 --> 00:44:55,704
since you were old enough
to want anything,

412
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:57,672
it's all yours for the taking.

413
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,376
Are you afraid?

414
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:06,414
Good.

415
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:09,251
You're in the great game now.

416
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:11,920
And the great game's terrifying.

417
00:45:12,022 --> 00:45:14,489
The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

418
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:16,691
are madmen like your father.

419
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:20,896
Do you know what frightens me?

420
00:45:22,366 --> 00:45:25,033
I said farewell
to a man who loves me.

421
00:45:26,904 --> 00:45:30,472
A man I thought I cared for.

422
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:32,541
And I felt nothing.

423
00:45:34,144 --> 00:45:36,044
Just impatient to get on with it.

424
00:45:39,149 --> 00:45:42,217
He wasn't the first to love you

425
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,386
and he won't be the last.

426
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:53,194
Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

427
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,233
For what it's worth,
I've been a cynic

428
00:45:58,335 --> 00:46:00,468
for as long as I can remember.

429
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:03,371
Everyone's always asking me
to believe in things--

430
00:46:03,473 --> 00:46:07,208
family, gods, kings, myself.

431
00:46:07,311 --> 00:46:09,144
It was often tempting

432
00:46:09,246 --> 00:46:11,580
until I saw where belief got people.

433
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:15,550
So I said no, thank you to belief.

434
00:46:15,652 --> 00:46:18,954
And yet here I am.

435
00:46:21,658 --> 00:46:23,925
I believe in you.

436
00:46:25,862 --> 00:46:28,263
It's embarrassing, really.

437
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,133
I'd swear you my sword,

438
00:46:32,235 --> 00:46:35,270
but I don't actually own a sword.

439
00:46:35,372 --> 00:46:37,372
It's your counsel I need.

440
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:39,908
It's yours.

441
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,443
Now and always.

442
00:46:42,946 --> 00:46:44,779
Good.

443
00:46:46,083 --> 00:46:48,116
I, um...

444
00:46:48,218 --> 00:46:49,985
I had something made for you.

445
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:54,222
I'm not sure if it's right.

446
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:06,234
Tyrion Lannister,

447
00:47:06,336 --> 00:47:08,236
I name you Hand of the Queen.

448
00:47:42,472 --> 00:47:45,006
You're not one of mine, are you?

449
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:46,608
No, my lord.

450
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,376
Didn't think so.

451
00:47:48,478 --> 00:47:50,712
Too pretty.

452
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:57,786
Where are my damn moron sons?

453
00:47:57,888 --> 00:48:01,623
Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

454
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,558
They're here, my lord.

455
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,961
Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

456
00:48:07,064 --> 00:48:09,130
Tell them to come here now.

457
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:11,499
But they're already here, my lord.

458
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:18,540
Here, my lord.

459
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,860
They weren't easy to carve.

460
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:42,430
Especially Black Walder.

461
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:45,100
What...

462
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:54,175
My name is Arya Stark.

463
00:48:54,277 --> 00:48:55,777
I want you to know that.

464
00:48:55,879 --> 00:48:58,613
The last thing
you're ever going to see

465
00:48:58,715 --> 00:49:01,449
is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

466
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:58,239
Forgive me, my lady...

467
00:49:59,676 --> 00:50:02,677
if you're at prayer.

468
00:50:02,779 --> 00:50:04,779
I'm done with all that.

469
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:09,517
I came here every day
when I was a girl.

470
00:50:10,813 --> 00:50:14,055
I prayed to be somewhere else.

471
00:50:14,157 --> 00:50:16,257
Back then I only thought
about what I wanted,

472
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:18,193
never about what I had.

473
00:50:21,965 --> 00:50:23,398
I was a stupid girl.

474
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,433
You were a child.

475
00:50:28,738 --> 00:50:31,206
What do you want?

476
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:33,675
I thought you knew what I wanted.

477
00:50:33,777 --> 00:50:35,376
I was wrong.

478
00:50:35,478 --> 00:50:38,146
No, you weren't.

479
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:42,815
Every time I'm faced with a decision,

480
00:50:42,917 --> 00:50:45,151
I close my eyes and see
the same picture.

481
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:50,256
Whenever I consider
an action, I ask myself

482
00:50:50,358 --> 00:50:54,493
will this action help to make
this picture a reality?

483
00:50:56,464 --> 00:50:59,232
Pull it out of my mind

484
00:50:59,334 --> 00:51:01,167
and into the world?

485
00:51:03,271 --> 00:51:06,239
And I only act if the answer is yes.

486
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:13,579
A picture of me on the Iron Throne...

487
00:51:16,384 --> 00:51:18,284
and you by my side.

488
00:51:28,363 --> 00:51:30,263
It's a pretty picture.

489
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:39,305
News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

490
00:51:39,407 --> 00:51:42,908
I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

491
00:51:43,011 --> 00:51:45,478
You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

492
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,281
It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

493
00:51:48,383 --> 00:51:50,583
The past is gone for good.

494
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:52,752
You can sit here
mourning its departure

495
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:55,788
or you can prepare for the future.

496
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,357
You, my love,

497
00:51:58,459 --> 00:52:01,093
are the future of House Stark.

498
00:52:01,195 --> 00:52:04,864
Who should the North rally behind?

499
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:07,633
A trueborn daughter
of Ned and Catelyn Stark

500
00:52:07,735 --> 00:52:09,635
born here at Winterfell

501
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:12,938
or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

502
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,634
This is where I leave you.

503
00:52:41,736 --> 00:52:43,536
You're not coming with us?

504
00:52:45,006 --> 00:52:48,407
The Wall is not just ice and stone.

505
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:51,677
Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

506
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:55,548
Strong magic

507
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,784
to protect men from what lies beyond.

508
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:02,722
And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

509
00:53:02,824 --> 00:53:03,824
I cannot pass.

510
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:22,475
Where will you go?

511
00:53:22,577 --> 00:53:24,110
The great war is coming

512
00:53:24,212 --> 00:53:27,012
<i>and I still fight for the living.</i>

513
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:31,183
I'll do what I can...

514
00:53:32,553 --> 00:53:34,754
as long as I can.

515
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:40,760
Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

516
00:53:40,862 --> 00:53:43,195
I wish you both good fortune.

517
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:25,004
Are you sure you're ready for this?

518
00:54:25,106 --> 00:54:28,207
I'm the Three-Eyed
Raven now.

519
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:30,543
I have to be ready for this.

520
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:06,779
<i>Ned?</i>

521
00:55:06,881 --> 00:55:09,381
Lyanna.

522
00:55:09,484 --> 00:55:11,584
Is that you?

523
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:17,356
Is that really you?

524
00:55:22,296 --> 00:55:24,196
You're not a dream?

525
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:27,433
No, I'm not a dream.

526
00:55:29,103 --> 00:55:30,970
I'm here.

527
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,406
Right here.

528
00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:36,842
I've missed you, big brother.

529
00:55:40,181 --> 00:55:42,181
I've missed you, too.

530
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:48,420
I want to be brave.

531
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:50,956
Shh.

532
00:55:51,058 --> 00:55:53,559
You are.

533
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:56,395
I'm not.

534
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:01,367
I don't want to die.

535
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:03,702
You're not going to die.

536
00:56:07,508 --> 00:56:09,341
Get her some water.

537
00:56:09,443 --> 00:56:11,744
- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

538
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:14,179
Listen to me, Ned.

539
00:56:20,588 --> 00:56:23,322
If Robert
finds out, he'll--

540
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:25,291
you know he will.

541
00:56:25,393 --> 00:56:27,259
You have to protect him.

542
00:56:30,331 --> 00:56:32,231
Promise me, Ned.

543
00:56:34,635 --> 00:56:36,502
Promise me.

544
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:50,616
Promise me, Ned.

545
00:56:55,089 --> 00:56:56,889
Promise me.

546
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:30,356
You can't expect Knights of the Vale

547
00:57:30,458 --> 00:57:33,092
to side with wildling invaders.

548
00:57:33,194 --> 00:57:37,129
We didn't invade.
We were invited.

549
00:57:37,231 --> 00:57:38,931
Not by me.

550
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:40,833
The free folk, the northerners,

551
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:43,302
and the Knights of the Vale
fought bravely,

552
00:57:43,404 --> 00:57:45,704
fought together, and we won.

553
00:57:45,806 --> 00:57:50,542
My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

554
00:57:50,645 --> 00:57:53,245
The Boltons are defeated.

555
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:55,280
The war is over.

556
00:57:55,383 --> 00:57:57,282
Winter has come.

557
00:57:57,385 --> 00:58:00,886
If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

558
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:04,423
We should ride home
and wait out the coming storms.

559
00:58:04,525 --> 00:58:06,625
The war is not over.

560
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:08,761
And I promise you, friend,

561
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:11,797
the true enemy
won't wait out the storm.

562
00:58:11,899 --> 00:58:13,399
He brings the storm.

563
00:58:33,387 --> 00:58:37,456
Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

564
00:58:37,558 --> 00:58:39,391
but you refused the call.

565
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,731
You swore allegiance
to House Stark, Lord Glover,

566
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:48,434
but in their hour of greatest need,

567
00:58:48,536 --> 00:58:50,536
you refused the call.

568
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,673
<i>And you, Lord Cerwyn,</i>

569
00:58:54,775 --> 00:58:58,644
your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

570
00:58:58,746 --> 00:59:01,213
Still you refused the call.

571
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:08,187
<i>But House Mormont remembers.</i>

572
00:59:08,289 --> 00:59:10,989
The North remembers.

573
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:15,661
We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

574
00:59:17,431 --> 00:59:19,198
<i>I don't care if he's a bastard.</i>

575
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,900
<i>Ned Stark's blood
runs through his veins.</i>

576
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:26,472
He's my king from this
day until his last day.

577
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:45,724
Lady Mormont speaks harshly

578
00:59:45,826 --> 00:59:47,126
and truly.

579
00:59:50,531 --> 00:59:55,634
My son died for Robb Stark,
the Young Wolf.

580
00:59:55,736 --> 00:59:58,804
I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

581
00:59:58,906 --> 01:00:01,340
I didn't commit my men to your cause

582
01:00:01,442 --> 01:00:04,076
'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

583
01:00:06,347 --> 01:00:07,813
But I was wrong.

584
01:00:13,521 --> 01:00:15,754
Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

585
01:00:15,856 --> 01:00:18,257
<i>He is the White Wolf.</i>

586
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:21,293
The King in the North.

587
01:00:28,769 --> 01:00:31,236
I did not fight
beside you on the field

588
01:00:31,338 --> 01:00:34,773
and I will regret that
until my dying day.

589
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:39,511
<i>A man can only admit
when he was wrong</i>

590
01:00:39,613 --> 01:00:41,180
and ask forgiveness.

591
01:00:44,185 --> 01:00:46,485
There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

592
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:51,590
There will be more fights to come.

593
01:00:51,692 --> 01:00:55,227
House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

594
01:00:55,329 --> 01:00:57,629
as we have for a thousand years.

595
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:01,700
And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

596
01:01:04,138 --> 01:01:06,205
the King in the North!

597
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:11,009
The King in the North!

598
01:01:11,111 --> 01:01:14,413
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

599
01:01:14,515 --> 01:01:17,850
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

600
01:01:17,952 --> 01:01:21,153
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

601
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:24,756
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

602
01:01:24,859 --> 01:01:28,527
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

603
01:01:28,629 --> 01:01:32,497
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

604
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,467
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

605
01:01:35,569 --> 01:01:38,737
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

606
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:42,040
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

607
01:01:42,142 --> 01:01:45,444
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

608
01:01:45,546 --> 01:01:48,380
The King in the North!
The King in the North!

609
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:56,588
<i>Company halt!</i>

610
01:01:59,593 --> 01:02:01,059
<i>Halt!</i>

611
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:05,063
<i>Halt!</i>

612
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:17,743
Come on.

613
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,501
I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

614
01:03:16,603 --> 01:03:19,237
First of Her Name,

615
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:22,708
<i>Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,</i>

616
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:26,011
Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

617
01:04:11,859 --> 01:04:13,925
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

618
01:04:14,028 --> 01:04:16,194
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

619
01:06:39,173 --> 01:06:49,749

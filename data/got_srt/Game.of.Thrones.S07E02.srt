3
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,688
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

4
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,979
I remember that storm.

5
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,729
All the dogs in King's Landing

6
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,729
howled through the night.

7
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,355
I wish I could remember it.

8
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:40,271
I always thought this
would be a homecoming.

9
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:42,063
Doesn't feel like home.

10
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:44,397
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.

11
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,689
Good.

12
00:02:47,106 --> 00:02:48,938
Not so many lions.

13
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,854
Cersei controls fewer than
half the Seven Kingdoms.

14
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:54,146
The lords of Westeros despise her.

15
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,021
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

16
00:02:57,022 --> 00:03:00,522
- Now...
- They cry out for their true queen?

17
00:03:00,523 --> 00:03:03,146
They drink secret toasts to my health?

18
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:05,105
People used to tell my
brother that sort of thing,

19
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:07,147
and he was stupid
enough to believe them.

20
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,979
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

21
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,979
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

22
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,563
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

23
00:03:20,564 --> 00:03:22,980
But you're not here to
be queen of the ashes.

24
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,729
No.

25
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,979
We can take the Seven Kingdoms

26
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,854
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

27
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,438
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

28
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,522
the game is won.

29
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,979
With the Tyrell army and
the Dornish on our side,

30
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,146
we have powerful allies in the south.

31
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:43,729
I never properly thanked you for that.

32
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,480
They joined our side, my queen,

33
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,021
because they believe in you.

34
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,356
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

35
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:53,979
I did.

36
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,313
And then you served the
man who overthrew him.

37
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:57,063
I had a choice, Your Grace...

38
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:59,188
serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

39
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,522
But you didn't serve him long.

40
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:02,980
You turned against him.

41
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,146
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

42
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:10,230
There have been few rulers in history

43
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,313
as cruel as the Mad King.

44
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,771
Robert was neither mad nor cruel.

45
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:17,313
He simply had no interest in being king.

46
00:04:17,314 --> 00:04:20,021
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

47
00:04:20,022 --> 00:04:22,230
Your Grace,

48
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:25,230
when I was ready to drink
myself into a small coffin,

49
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,271
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who...

50
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:30,189
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

51
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,896
All your spies, your little birds,

52
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:38,564
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

53
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:42,994
Would those qualities
have made for a good king

54
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:45,188
in your learned opinion?

55
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,854
Until your marriage to
Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

56
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,355
I knew nothing about
you, save your existence

57
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,688
and that you were said to be beautiful.

58
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:56,397
So you and your friends traded me
like a prized horse to the Dothraki.

59
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:58,397
Which you turned to your advantage.

60
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,439
Who gave the order to kill me?

61
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,480
King Robert.

62
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:09,230
Who hired the assassins?

63
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:12,397
Who sent word to Essos to
murder Daenerys Targaryen?

64
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,938
- Your Grace, I did what had to be done to...
- To keep yourself alive.

65
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:19,230
Lord Varys has proven
himself a loyal servant.

66
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,021
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

67
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:24,729
If he dislikes one monarch, he
conspires to crown the next one.

68
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,146
What kind of a servant is that?

69
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,271
The kind the realm needs.

70
00:05:29,272 --> 00:05:32,647
Incompetence should not be
rewarded with blind loyalty.

71
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,606
As long as I have my
eyes, I'll use them.

72
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:39,313
I wasn't born into a great house.

73
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:41,896
I came from nothing.

74
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:44,854
I was sold as a slave and
carved up as an offering.

75
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:48,688
When I was a child, I lived in
alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.

76
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:51,271
You wish to know where
my true loyalties lie?

77
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:54,480
Not with any king or
queen, but with the people.

78
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:58,438
The people who suffer under
despots and prosper under just rule.

79
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,814
The people whose hearts you aim to win.

80
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:06,522
If you demand blind allegiance,

81
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:09,271
I respect your wishes.

82
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:13,271
Grey Worm can behead me or
your dragons can devour me.

83
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,854
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

84
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:19,146
I will dedicate myself to
seeing you on the Iron Throne

85
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:21,647
because I choose you.

86
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:25,189
Because I know the people
have no better chance than you.

87
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:35,648
Swear this to me, Varys.

88
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:40,605
If you ever think I'm
failing the people,

89
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,813
you won't conspire behind my back.

90
00:06:43,814 --> 00:06:45,771
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

91
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,606
and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.

92
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:52,606
I swear it, my queen.

93
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,854
And I swear this...
if you ever betray me,

94
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,564
I'll burn you alive.

95
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:11,314
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

96
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:16,355
Forgive me, my queen.

97
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:19,523
A red priestess from
As'shai has come to see you.

98
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:35,721
_

99
00:07:35,841 --> 00:07:37,659
_

100
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:39,489
_

101
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:41,493
_

102
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:44,717
_

103
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:47,789
_

104
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:50,419
_

105
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,238
_

106
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,342
_

107
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:59,605
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

108
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:03,522
It didn't end well for
Stannis Baratheon, did it?

109
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,188
No, it didn't.

110
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,021
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

111
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,896
We've just decided to pardon those

112
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:13,564
who once served the wrong king.

113
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:20,896
The Lord of Light doesn't have
many followers in Westeros, does he?

114
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:24,563
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

115
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:26,063
can serve his cause.

116
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:27,980
What does your lord expect from me?

117
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:36,314
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

118
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,605
I'm afraid I'm not a prince.

119
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:41,188
Your Grace, forgive me,

120
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:44,146
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

121
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:46,896
That noun has no
gender in High Valyrian,

122
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:49,854
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

123
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:54,230
"The prince or princess who was
promised will bring the dawn."

124
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,397
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

125
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:57,939
No, but I like it better.

126
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:01,480
And you believe this
prophecy refers to me?

127
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:04,271
Prophecies are dangerous things.

128
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:07,605
I believe you have a role to play.

129
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:09,480
As does another...

130
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,980
the King in the North, Jon Snow.

131
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,688
Jon Snow?

132
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:17,480
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

133
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:20,647
I travelled with him to the Wall
when he joined the Night's Watch.

134
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:24,771
And why do you think the Lord of
Light singled out this Jon Snow?

135
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,480
Aside from the visions you've
seen in the flames, that is.

136
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:30,397
As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch,

137
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:32,647
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

138
00:09:32,648 --> 00:09:34,729
to protect them from grave danger.

139
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,313
As King in the North,

140
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:39,146
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

141
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:41,647
so together they may
face their common enemy.

142
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,771
He sounds like quite a man.

143
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:46,146
Summon Jon Snow.

144
00:09:46,147 --> 00:09:47,813
Let him stand before you

145
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,438
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

146
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:53,064
the things that he has
seen with his own eyes.

147
00:09:54,606 --> 00:09:56,230
I can't speak to prophecies

148
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:58,854
or visions in the flames,

149
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:01,647
but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him.

150
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:04,146
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

151
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:06,605
If he does rule the North,

152
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,356
he would make a valuable ally.

153
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:11,605
The Lannisters executed his father

154
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,771
and conspired to murder his brother.

155
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:16,980
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

156
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:23,146
Very well.

157
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:24,938
Send a raven north.

158
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,938
Tell Jon Snow that his queen

159
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:29,938
invites him to come to Dragonstone...

160
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:31,689
and bend the knee.

161
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:44,230
Gather round. Come here.

162
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:46,729
You think it's really Tyrion?

163
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,230
It could be someone trying
to lure you into a trap.

164
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,771
Read the last bit.

165
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:56,397
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

166
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,146
What does that mean?

167
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:01,064
It's something he said to
me the first night we met.

168
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:04,231
You know him better than any of us.

169
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,398
What do you think?

170
00:11:09,855 --> 00:11:12,480
Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters.

171
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:16,271
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

172
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,271
"The Seven Kingdoms will bleed

173
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,771
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

174
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:21,938
Join us.

175
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:23,772
Together, we can end her tyranny."

176
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,938
Sounds like a charmer.

177
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,146
Of course, the casual
mention of a Dothraki horde,

178
00:11:32,147 --> 00:11:35,105
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons...

179
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:36,648
a bit less charming.

180
00:11:38,772 --> 00:11:39,813
What?

181
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:43,063
Fire kills wights, you told me.

182
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,231
What breathes fire?

183
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,438
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?

184
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,854
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

185
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:53,813
But if the Army of the
Dead makes it past the Wall,

186
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,314
do we have enough men to fight them?

187
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:03,021
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

188
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,939
she'll destroy the realm as we know it.

189
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:09,188
Some of you are
bannermen of House Tyrell.

190
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:12,313
But House Tyrell is in open
rebellion against the crown.

191
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,522
With their help, the Mad King's daughter

192
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:19,021
has ferried an army of
savages to our shores...

193
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,850
mindless Unsullied soldiers

194
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,813
who will destroy your
castles and your holdfasts,

195
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:26,979
Dothraki heathens who will burn
your villages to the ground,

196
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,188
rape and enslave your women,

197
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:32,105
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

198
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:36,979
This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards
centuries of service and loyalty.

199
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,813
You all remember the Mad King.

200
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:43,355
You remember the horrors he
inflicted upon his people.

201
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:45,355
His daughter is no different.

202
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:48,146
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

203
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:52,438
She crucified hundreds of
noblemen in Slaver's Bay.

204
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,105
And when she grew bored of that,

205
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,355
she fed them to her dragons.

206
00:12:57,356 --> 00:13:00,938
It is my solemn duty to
protect the people, and I will.

207
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,105
But I need your help, my lords.

208
00:13:04,106 --> 00:13:06,897
We must stand together, all of us...

209
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:10,105
if we hope to stop her.

210
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,523
She has three full-grown
dragons, Your Grace.

211
00:13:19,897 --> 00:13:21,688
The same as Aegon when he conquered

212
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:24,188
the Seven Kingdoms.

213
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:26,564
How do you propose to stop them?

214
00:13:30,231 --> 00:13:34,356
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

215
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,231
Lord Tarly.

216
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,979
Ser Jaime.

217
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,688
I believe you know my son.

218
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:48,689
Ser Jaime.

219
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,188
Rickard, isn't it?

220
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:51,896
Dickon.

221
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,438
That's it.

222
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,438
Thank you for coming.

223
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,264
The other lords of the Reach
look to you for guidance,

224
00:13:58,265 --> 00:13:59,355
now more than ever.

225
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,063
They might not have come if you hadn't.

226
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:04,355
If my queen summons
me, I answer the call.

227
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,147
And I've heard what she
does to those who defy her.

228
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:12,397
You ride for Horn Hill today?

229
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:15,105
I have an army to mobilize.

230
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:17,438
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

231
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,897
And which side will you be fighting for?

232
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:24,230
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

233
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,146
Not even Rhaegar
Targaryen could do that.

234
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:29,105
It's a long ride back to the
Reach, Ser Jaime. How may I serve?

235
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:32,063
I want you to be my ranking
general in the wars to come.

236
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:34,188
I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei

237
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:37,188
and I want you to help
me destroy her enemies.

238
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:39,021
All her enemies.

239
00:14:39,022 --> 00:14:41,064
Including Olenna Tyrell.

240
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:46,313
I'm a Tarly.

241
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,814
That name means something.

242
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,854
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

243
00:14:51,855 --> 00:14:54,313
We don't stab our rivals in the back

244
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:57,147
or cut their throats at weddings.

245
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:02,188
I swore an oath to House Tyrell.

246
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:05,523
You swore an oath to the
crown as well, Lord Tarly.

247
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,313
I've known Olenna since I was a child.

248
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:11,938
She was a great woman once.

249
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:14,313
Now she's broken.

250
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,438
She wants revenge so badly,

251
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,688
she brought the Dothraki to our shores.

252
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:22,606
The Dothraki in Westeros for
the first time in history.

253
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,522
I know you don't like my sister,

254
00:15:27,523 --> 00:15:30,688
but you have to make a choice.

255
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:32,729
Do you fight with us

256
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,855
or with foreign savages and eunuchs?

257
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,355
When the war is won,

258
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,522
the queen will need a
new Warden of the South.

259
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:48,355
I can think of no better man

260
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:50,189
than Randyll Tarly.

261
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:55,021
The infection has spread too far.

262
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:57,980
You should have cut off your
arm the moment you were touched.

263
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:01,814
How long?

264
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,688
It'll be years before it kills you.

265
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,271
Could be 10.

266
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:09,938
Could be 20.

267
00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:11,689
But how long until...?

268
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,188
Your mind?

269
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,064
Six months, maybe fewer.

270
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,855
Um...

271
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:36,563
Pardon, Archmaester.

272
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:39,563
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

273
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:42,021
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

274
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:43,605
- No.
- Isn't there some way...

275
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:45,397
Does this look like a baby to you?

276
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,729
- No.
- Have you studied

277
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,771
the varying rates of
greyscale progression

278
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:50,398
in infants and fully grown men?

279
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,814
No.

280
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:57,188
Maester Cressen discovered

281
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,772
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

282
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:02,939
This is quite advanced.

283
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,980
And beyond our skills, ser.

284
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,397
Were you a commoner, I'd have
you shipped to Valyria at once

285
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,938
to live out your life
with the stone men.

286
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,772
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

287
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:25,106
How you choose to spend
that time is up to you.

288
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:32,606
Come, Samwell.

289
00:17:36,481 --> 00:17:39,356
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

290
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,980
Jorah.

291
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,313
Jorah Mormont.

292
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,355
Mormont?

293
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,105
There's no need.

294
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:52,689
I've been dead to them for years.

295
00:17:54,356 --> 00:17:56,022
Come, Samwell!

296
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,896
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

297
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:13,398
No, I can't say I have.

298
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:17,538
I haven't seen these since Robert

299
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,105
had them removed from the throne room.

300
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:23,063
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

301
00:18:23,064 --> 00:18:25,230
They were his trophies.

302
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,438
He couldn't keep them around.

303
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,355
They would have made him look small.

304
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:31,897
Sometimes he would come
down here and look at them.

305
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,064
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

306
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:46,189
Balerion the Dread.

307
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,605
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

308
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,522
His flames forged the Iron Throne

309
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:56,398
and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.

310
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:58,730
Powerful...

311
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:01,272
but not invincible.

312
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,063
Apparently, one of Daenerys's dragons

313
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,730
was wounded by spears in
the fighting pits of Meereen.

314
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:16,563
And if they can be wounded,

315
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:17,939
they can be killed.

316
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:23,230
The finest artillators and
blacksmiths in King's Landing

317
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:26,064
have been laboring day
and night, Your Grace.

318
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:35,106
If you'll kindly pull that lever.

319
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:54,106
If you want the Iron Throne, take it.

320
00:19:56,189 --> 00:19:59,271
We have an army, a
fleet, and three dragons.

321
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:02,938
We should hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

322
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,438
The city will fall within a day.

323
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,078
If we turn the dragons loose,

324
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,355
tens of thousands will
die in the firestorms.

325
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:09,938
It's called war.

326
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,938
You don't have the stomach for
it, scurry back into hiding.

327
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,271
I know how you wage war.

328
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:17,021
We don't poison little girls here.

329
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:18,313
Myrcella was innocent.

330
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:19,688
She was a Lannister.

331
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:22,313
There are no innocent Lannisters.

332
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,605
My greatest regret is that
Oberyn died fighting for you.

333
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:27,480
That's enough.

334
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,063
Lord Tyrion is Hand of the Queen.

335
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:30,481
You will treat him with respect.

336
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:37,481
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.

337
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,896
That's very nice to hear.

338
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,854
Of course, I can't remember a queen

339
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:45,813
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

340
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,771
The common people loved her.

341
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,522
The nobles loved her.

342
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:51,271
And what is left of her now?

343
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:54,105
Ashes.

344
00:20:54,106 --> 00:20:55,813
Commoners, nobles,

345
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:57,688
they're all just children, really.

346
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:01,314
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

347
00:21:03,314 --> 00:21:05,563
I'm grateful to you, Lady
Olenna, for your counsel.

348
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,480
I'm grateful to all of you.

349
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:10,105
But you have chosen to follow me.

350
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:12,480
I will not attack King's Landing.

351
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:15,313
We will not attack King's Landing.

352
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:18,979
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

353
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,314
By asking nicely?

354
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,854
We will lay siege to the capital,

355
00:21:23,855 --> 00:21:25,563
surrounding the city on all sides.

356
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,355
Cersei will have the Iron Throne,

357
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,729
but no food for her army or the people.

358
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,647
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.

359
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:34,688
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

360
00:21:34,689 --> 00:21:36,355
by appealing to their loyalty,

361
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:38,021
their love for their country.

362
00:21:38,022 --> 00:21:39,938
If we besiege the city with foreigners,

363
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:41,647
we prove her point.

364
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:43,271
Our army should be Westerosi.

365
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:45,563
And I suppose we're
providing the Westerosi?

366
00:21:45,564 --> 00:21:46,854
You are.

367
00:21:46,855 --> 00:21:50,231
Lady Greyjoy will escort
you home to Sunspear.

368
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:56,230
And her Iron Fleet will
ferry the Dornish army

369
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,230
back up to King's Landing.

370
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:01,063
The Dornish will lay
siege to the capital

371
00:22:01,064 --> 00:22:03,105
alongside the Tyrell army.

372
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:05,771
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

373
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:10,896
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

374
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:14,272
Forgive me for asking, but why
did you bother to bring your own?

375
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,771
The Unsullied will
have another objective.

376
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:22,355
For decades, House Lannister has
been the true power in Westeros.

377
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:26,522
And the seat of that
power is Casterly Rock.

378
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:28,438
Grey Worm and the Unsullied

379
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:31,314
will sail for the Rock and take it.

380
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:51,481
Do I have your support?

381
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,648
You have mine.

382
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,314
Dorne is with you, Your Grace.

383
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:03,980
Thank you all.

384
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,314
Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?

385
00:23:16,272 --> 00:23:20,688
I realize you're here out of hatred
for Cersei and not love for me.

386
00:23:20,689 --> 00:23:24,605
But I swear to you, she
will pay for what she's done.

387
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:27,271
And we will bring
peace back to Westeros.

388
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,313
Peace?

389
00:23:29,314 --> 00:23:31,979
Do you think that's what
we had under your father?

390
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,105
Or his father? Or his?

391
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:37,771
Peace never lasts, my dear.

392
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:40,106
Will you take a bit of
advice from an old woman?

393
00:23:42,147 --> 00:23:44,105
He's a clever man, your Hand.

394
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:47,938
I've known a great many clever men.

395
00:23:47,939 --> 00:23:49,854
I've outlived them all.

396
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:51,771
You know why?

397
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:53,313
I ignored them.

398
00:23:53,314 --> 00:23:56,813
The lords of Westeros are sheep.

399
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:58,189
Are you a sheep?

400
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,522
No.

401
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,813
You're a dragon.

402
00:24:03,814 --> 00:24:05,356
Be a dragon.

403
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:11,688
Mají.

404
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:17,814
You leave tomorrow.

405
00:24:20,648 --> 00:24:23,063
Were you going to say goodbye?

406
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:25,688
I will see you when I return.

407
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:27,564
But you don't know when that will be.

408
00:24:29,564 --> 00:24:30,639
No one knows.

409
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,398
I wish you good fortune.

410
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:38,939
Missandei.

411
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,896
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.

412
00:24:49,897 --> 00:24:51,105
Why?

413
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:52,771
You know why.

414
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:53,855
I don't.

415
00:24:57,106 --> 00:25:00,523
Y... you are my weakness.

416
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:03,979
That's what I am?

417
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,438
Your weakness?

418
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:09,147
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

419
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:13,105
One boy is scared of dogs,

420
00:25:13,106 --> 00:25:14,979
one boy hates high places,

421
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,813
one is frightened of the ocean.

422
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:20,271
They make the boy sleep with dogs

423
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:22,188
or climb a cliff.

424
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:24,480
They throw him in the water.

425
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,771
If he learns to swim, good.

426
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,730
If he drowns, good.

427
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:32,938
Either way, strong Unsullied.

428
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:35,355
But I had no fears.

429
00:25:35,356 --> 00:25:39,147
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

430
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:43,814
but I was bravest, always.

431
00:25:45,272 --> 00:25:47,230
- I believe it.
- Until...

432
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:51,022
I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.

433
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:55,814
Now I have fear.

434
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:02,648
I do, too.

435
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,855
No.

436
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,064
I want to see you.

437
00:27:24,439 --> 00:27:25,772
Please.

438
00:28:58,606 --> 00:28:59,771
Might be useful.

439
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,647
Ch'Vyalthan was a dreadful writer,

440
00:29:01,648 --> 00:29:03,480
but an excellent researcher.

441
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,938
- Archmaester, I wondered if I...
- And this one.

442
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,813
Maester Faull was quite the opposite...

443
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,563
a brilliant stylist who invented
half the stories he tells.

444
00:29:10,564 --> 00:29:12,188
Um, I wanted to ask you...

445
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:13,979
If you're going to
write histories, Tarly,

446
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,563
you have to do the research.

447
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,438
If you want people to
read your histories,

448
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:19,688
you need a bit of style.

449
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:21,688
I'm not writing "A Chronicle of the Wars

450
00:29:21,689 --> 00:29:23,522
Following the Death of King Robert I"

451
00:29:23,523 --> 00:29:25,814
so it can sit on a shelf unread.

452
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,648
What? You don't like the title?

453
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,188
What would you call it, then?

454
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:36,522
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

455
00:29:36,523 --> 00:29:39,271
We're not poets, Tarly.

456
00:29:39,272 --> 00:29:41,438
Um, Archmaester, if I
could just have a moment.

457
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:43,188
This is your moment.

458
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:44,648
Use it wisely.

459
00:29:46,564 --> 00:29:48,648
I may have found a
way to treat Ser Jorah.

460
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:52,021
There are two recorded cases

461
00:29:52,022 --> 00:29:53,854
of advanced greyscale being cured.

462
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,013
I found the procedure in
the study of rare diseases

463
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:57,021
by Archmaester Pylos.

464
00:29:57,022 --> 00:29:59,188
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos

465
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:01,146
and his study of rare diseases.

466
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:03,146
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

467
00:30:03,147 --> 00:30:05,064
And shall I tell you how he died?

468
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:07,564
From greyscale.

469
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:11,230
- Oh.
- The procedure's far too dangerous,

470
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:12,398
which is why it's now forbidden.

471
00:30:56,814 --> 00:30:58,230
Hello.

472
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,772
What are you doing?

473
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:04,313
You're Jorah Mormont,

474
00:31:04,314 --> 00:31:06,272
the only son of Jeor Mormont.

475
00:31:07,606 --> 00:31:09,397
My name is Samwell Tarly,

476
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:11,188
Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch,

477
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:13,979
training to serve as
maester at Castle Black.

478
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,271
I knew your father.

479
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:16,772
I was with him when he died.

480
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,980
You are not dying today, Ser Jorah.

481
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,605
Drink this.

482
00:31:32,606 --> 00:31:34,397
- What is it?
- Rum.

483
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:36,314
Drink it all, please. I'm
afraid this is going to hurt.

484
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,648
If you could take off your shirt.

485
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:16,523
If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.

486
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:19,979
I'm sorry, but no one knows I'm here,

487
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,022
and if they hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

488
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:27,689
Have you ever done this before?

489
00:32:35,147 --> 00:32:36,222
No.

490
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:40,398
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

491
00:32:43,897 --> 00:32:45,356
Have a seat.

492
00:32:49,564 --> 00:32:52,271
I'm going to have to remove the
entire upper layer of infected tissue,

493
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,564
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

494
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:10,397
Shh, shh!

495
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,647
Shh.

496
00:33:12,648 --> 00:33:15,063
Again, I'm sorry,

497
00:33:15,064 --> 00:33:17,564
but please try not to scream.

498
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:18,896
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

499
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:21,647
Horseshit. Cersei's just
trying to frighten us.

500
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:23,230
I hope it's true.

501
00:34:23,231 --> 00:34:26,271
If she lays siege to King's
Landing, prices will triple.

502
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:29,647
As long as we get back
there before they start.

503
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:32,189
One more round. It's a long ride.

504
00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:35,647
Arry!

505
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,855
Hello, Hot Pie.

506
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:39,189
Sit down.

507
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:42,855
Who's that for?

508
00:34:51,648 --> 00:34:53,356
Mm. This is good.

509
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:56,813
You think so?

510
00:34:56,814 --> 00:34:59,563
The secret is browning the
butter before making the dough.

511
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,522
Most people don't do that
'cause it takes up too much time.

512
00:35:02,523 --> 00:35:04,146
Mm, I didn't do that.

513
00:35:04,147 --> 00:35:05,688
You've been making pies?

514
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,021
One or two.

515
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,021
I can't believe you're here.

516
00:35:10,022 --> 00:35:12,480
Did you meet the big lady?

517
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:15,480
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

518
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,688
You know, I figured she was a
knight 'cause she had armor on.

519
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:21,522
She was looking for your
sister, but I told her about you.

520
00:35:21,523 --> 00:35:23,022
Did she ever find you?

521
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:25,980
She found me.

522
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:32,523
What happened to you, Arry?

523
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:44,022
You got any ale?

524
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:01,563
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

525
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:04,063
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's queen now.

526
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:05,647
Heard she blew up the Great Sept.

527
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:07,230
That must have been something to see.

528
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,021
- Boom.
- Mm.

529
00:36:09,022 --> 00:36:11,230
I can't believe someone would do that.

530
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:12,772
Cersei would do that.

531
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,979
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

532
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,105
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

533
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:22,564
No, the Boltons are dead.

534
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,938
What?

535
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:28,105
Jon Snow came down from Castle
Black with a wildling army

536
00:36:28,106 --> 00:36:29,896
and won the Battle of the Bastards.

537
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,314
He's King of the North now.

538
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:34,105
You're lying.

539
00:36:34,106 --> 00:36:35,979
Why would I lie about that?

540
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,439
He's your brother, right?

541
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:46,771
Thanks for the pie.

542
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,688
Friends don't pay.

543
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,979
Can't believe I thought you were a boy.

544
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,897
You're pretty.

545
00:36:54,106 --> 00:36:55,106
Thanks.

546
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:02,523
Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.

547
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:05,313
Try not to get killed.

548
00:37:05,314 --> 00:37:06,729
Ah, I won't.

549
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,979
I'm like you, Arry.

550
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,648
I'm a survivor.

551
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:15,980
200 miles to King's Landing.

552
00:37:17,523 --> 00:37:19,648
One bottle of rum. You
think we'll make it?

553
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,397
Come in.

554
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,855
A raven, my king, from the Citadel.

555
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:11,397
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

556
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:14,729
He was my brother at the Night's Watch,

557
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,271
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

558
00:38:19,272 --> 00:38:22,063
He's discovered proof that Dragonstone

559
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:24,896
sits on a mountain of dragonglass.

560
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:33,230
I received this a few days ago

561
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:34,855
from Dragonstone.

562
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,854
It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.

563
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:44,230
He is now Hand of the
Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.

564
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:48,271
She intends to take the Iron
Throne from Cersei Lannister.

565
00:38:48,272 --> 00:38:50,188
She has a powerful army at her back

566
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:54,063
and, if this message is to be believed,

567
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:55,355
three dragons.

568
00:38:57,356 --> 00:39:00,105
Lord Tyrion has invited
me to Dragonstone

569
00:39:00,106 --> 00:39:01,855
to meet with Daenerys.

570
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:04,605
And I'm going to accept.

571
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:05,939
Accept?!

572
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:12,397
We need this dragonglass, my lords!

573
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:14,355
We know that dragonglass can destroy

574
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:16,271
both white walkers and their army.

575
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,814
We need to mine it and
turn it into weapons.

576
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:23,188
But more importantly, we need allies!

577
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:27,480
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

578
00:39:27,481 --> 00:39:29,230
We can't defeat them on our own.

579
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:31,063
We don't have the numbers.

580
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:34,771
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

581
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:38,063
I need to try and persuade
her to fight with us.

582
00:39:38,064 --> 00:39:41,188
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

583
00:39:41,189 --> 00:39:43,605
then sail for Dragonstone.

584
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:46,522
Have you forgotten what
happened to our grandfather?

585
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:48,729
The Mad King invited
him to King's Landing

586
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,021
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

587
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:54,146
She is here to reclaim the Iron
Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.

588
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:56,146
The North is one of
those seven kingdoms.

589
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:58,979
This isn't an invitation; it's a trap.

590
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,271
It could be, but I don't
believe Tyrion would do that.

591
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:04,647
You know him. He's a good man.

592
00:40:04,648 --> 00:40:08,480
Your Grace, with respect, I
must agree with Lady Sansa.

593
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:11,563
I remember the Mad King all too well.

594
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:14,313
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

595
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:16,522
- Nor can a Lannister.
- Yeah!

596
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:19,979
Aye. We called your brother king.

597
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,896
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

598
00:40:23,897 --> 00:40:27,688
Winter is here, Your Grace.

599
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:30,563
We need the King in
the North in the North.

600
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:33,897
Aye!

601
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,648
You all crowned me your king.

602
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:48,854
I never wanted it.

603
00:40:48,855 --> 00:40:51,313
I never asked for it.

604
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:55,605
But I accepted it because
the North is my home.

605
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:59,896
It's part of me, and I will
never stop fighting for it,

606
00:40:59,897 --> 00:41:01,314
no matter the odds.

607
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:05,980
But the odds are against us.

608
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:12,188
None of you have seen the
Army of the Dead. None of you.

609
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:16,230
We can never hope to defeat them alone.

610
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:19,231
We need allies, powerful allies.

611
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:24,064
I know it's a risk.

612
00:41:25,855 --> 00:41:27,271
But I have to take it.

613
00:41:27,272 --> 00:41:30,021
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

614
00:41:30,022 --> 00:41:31,563
Daenerys is a queen.

615
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:33,896
Only a king can convince her to help us.

616
00:41:33,897 --> 00:41:35,688
It has to be me.

617
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:37,647
You're abandoning your people!

618
00:41:37,648 --> 00:41:39,438
You're abandoning your home.

619
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:41,355
I'm leaving both in good hands.

620
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:42,772
- Whose?
- Yours.

621
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:46,271
You are my sister.

622
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:48,355
You're the only Stark in Winterfell.

623
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:52,272
Until I return, the North is yours.

624
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:17,398
I delivered his bones myself.

625
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:20,563
Presented them to Lady Catelyn

626
00:42:20,564 --> 00:42:23,064
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

627
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:25,897
Seems like a lifetime ago.

628
00:42:27,606 --> 00:42:30,231
Do give Lord Tyrion my
best when you see him.

629
00:42:33,648 --> 00:42:35,605
I was sorry when he died.

630
00:42:35,606 --> 00:42:39,314
Your father and I had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

631
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,523
So did I.

632
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,980
She wasn't fond of you, was she?

633
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:52,939
Well, it appears she
vastly underestimated you.

634
00:42:55,064 --> 00:42:56,397
Your father and brothers are gone,

635
00:42:56,398 --> 00:42:58,439
yet here you stand, King in the North.

636
00:42:59,814 --> 00:43:02,147
Last best hope against the coming storm.

637
00:43:07,272 --> 00:43:09,314
You don't belong down here.

638
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:12,106
Forgive me.

639
00:43:13,897 --> 00:43:17,355
We haven't ever talked... properly.

640
00:43:17,356 --> 00:43:18,855
I wanted to remedy that.

641
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:22,022
I have nothing to say to you.

642
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:26,105
Not even "thank you"?

643
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:30,355
If it weren't for me, you'd have
been slaughtered on that battlefield.

644
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:32,045
You have many enemies, my king,

645
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:33,730
but I swear to you, I'm not one of them.

646
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,397
I love Sansa,

647
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,063
as I loved her mother.

648
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:53,897
Touch my sister, and
I'll kill you myself.

649
00:44:19,772 --> 00:44:21,523
- Ready?
- Ready?

650
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:26,564
Ready!

651
00:44:30,064 --> 00:44:31,189
Come on.

652
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:36,939
- Yah!
- Come on!

653
00:46:26,231 --> 00:46:27,854
Nymeria?

654
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:45,564
Nymeria, it's me, Arya.

655
00:46:50,648 --> 00:46:52,897
I'm heading north, girl.

656
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,939
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

657
00:47:01,481 --> 00:47:02,730
Come with me.

658
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:14,356
Come with me.

659
00:47:42,481 --> 00:47:44,106
That's not you.

660
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,938
You can't have them all. It's not fair.

661
00:48:02,939 --> 00:48:04,355
I'm oldest.

662
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:06,480
Mama will want Cersei for herself.

663
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:08,480
She's not my mama.

664
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:10,563
You can have Cersei.

665
00:48:10,564 --> 00:48:13,105
I want the Mountain.

666
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:15,230
The Mountain killed Father.

667
00:48:15,231 --> 00:48:16,979
He'll crush you with one hand.

668
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,729
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

669
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,938
Will you shut up about Mama?

670
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:23,522
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

671
00:48:23,523 --> 00:48:27,397
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

672
00:48:27,398 --> 00:48:28,939
And then I won't have to share.

673
00:48:31,439 --> 00:48:32,648
"Mama!"

674
00:48:34,689 --> 00:48:36,647
How can you drink this piss?

675
00:48:36,648 --> 00:48:38,771
When we reach Sunspear,

676
00:48:38,772 --> 00:48:41,313
I'll treat you to a Dornish red.

677
00:48:41,314 --> 00:48:43,729
The best in the world.

678
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,146
Have you ever been to Dorne?

679
00:48:45,147 --> 00:48:47,146
A few times.

680
00:48:47,147 --> 00:48:48,522
Never stayed long.

681
00:48:48,523 --> 00:48:50,064
A boy in every port?

682
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:52,648
A boy, a girl.

683
00:48:54,189 --> 00:48:55,564
Depends on the port.

684
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,398
Could we get some more?

685
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,563
I thought it wasn't for you.

686
00:49:04,564 --> 00:49:06,855
I'm developing a taste for it.

687
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:10,648
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

688
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:17,355
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

689
00:49:17,356 --> 00:49:19,188
Once I kill my uncle.

690
00:49:19,189 --> 00:49:21,647
And what will you be, handsome?

691
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:23,355
Whatever my queen commands.

692
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:27,188
He'll be my advisor, my protector.

693
00:49:27,189 --> 00:49:29,438
Oh, I see.

694
00:49:29,439 --> 00:49:30,855
Your protector.

695
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:35,146
So, if someone gets too close to you...

696
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:36,938
He might have to intervene.

697
00:49:36,939 --> 00:49:38,729
To hold that person back.

698
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,398
Until they've made
their intentions known.

699
00:49:44,772 --> 00:49:46,689
Why are you standing all
the way over there, then?

700
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:50,313
A foreign invasion is underway.

701
00:49:50,314 --> 00:49:52,064
Leave him be.

702
00:49:55,314 --> 00:49:57,439
Seems like you don't need a protector.

703
00:50:03,231 --> 00:50:04,356
Stay here.

704
00:50:07,356 --> 00:50:10,314
We're under attack!

705
00:50:32,606 --> 00:50:34,064
Euron.

706
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,314
You mother's below deck. Keep her safe.

707
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:37,896
Aah!

708
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:52,730
Yah!

709
00:52:58,481 --> 00:52:59,498
Aah!

710
00:53:17,648 --> 00:53:18,772
Yah!

711
00:53:20,439 --> 00:53:21,514
Yah!

712
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,480
Kill us.

713
00:53:41,481 --> 00:53:42,939
Get it over with.

714
00:54:07,689 --> 00:54:09,147
Give your uncle a kiss.

715
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:47,897
Little Theon!

716
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,897
Ah, come on, you cockless coward.

717
00:55:08,564 --> 00:55:10,647
I have her.

718
00:55:10,648 --> 00:55:12,231
Come and get her.

719
00:56:46,648 --> 00:56:56,481

3
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,102
You could've killed me.

4
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:35,560
The fuck were you doing
back there?

5
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,852
Ending the war.

6
00:02:37,853 --> 00:02:40,059
Killing her.

7
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,477
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

8
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:48,477
And?

9
00:02:55,227 --> 00:02:57,059
Listen to me, cunt.

10
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,602
Till I get what I'm owed,

11
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,435
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

12
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,310
you don't get to kill you,

13
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,769
only I get to kill you.

14
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:09,768
That was only one of them.

15
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,602
She has two more.

16
00:03:12,603 --> 00:03:15,685
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

17
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:18,310
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean we're fucked?

18
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:20,310
No, I do not.

19
00:03:20,311 --> 00:03:23,476
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

20
00:03:23,477 --> 00:03:25,101
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

21
00:03:25,102 --> 00:03:26,853
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

22
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,352
I have to tell Cersei.

23
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,144
May as well jump
back in that river.

24
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,476
I know what Cersei has told you.

25
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:57,226
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

26
00:04:57,227 --> 00:04:58,476
burn down your homes,

27
00:04:58,477 --> 00:05:00,227
murder you,
and orphan your children.

28
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,852
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.

29
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,059
I'm not here to murder,

30
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,810
and all I want to destroy

31
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,893
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

32
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:18,102
to the benefit of no one but the
Cersei Lannisters of the world.

33
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:21,560
I offer you a choice...

34
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:23,893
bend the knee and join me.

35
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:28,059
Together, we will leave the world
a better place than we found it.

36
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,059
Or refuse...

37
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,561
and die.

38
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,102
Step forward, my lord.

39
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:14,226
You will not kneel?

40
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:15,603
I already have a queen.

41
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,310
My sister.

42
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,518
She wasn't your queen

43
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,560
until recently, though, was she?

44
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,893
When she murdered
your rightful queen

45
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:26,518
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

46
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,811
So it appears your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

47
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,852
There are
no easy choices in war.

48
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:36,226
Say what you will
about your sister,

49
00:06:36,227 --> 00:06:38,727
she was born in Westeros.

50
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:40,977
She's lived here all her life.

51
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:45,810
You, on the other hand,

52
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:48,560
murdered your own father

53
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:51,685
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

54
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:54,519
One with no ties to this land...

55
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:58,519
with an army of savages
at her back.

56
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,185
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

57
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:05,643
I respect that.

58
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:08,685
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

59
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:11,101
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

60
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:13,351
He'd be invaluable at the Wall.

61
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:15,686
You cannot send me to the Wall.

62
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,686
You are not my queen.

63
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:33,476
You will have to kill me, too.

64
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:35,352
Step back and shut your mouth.

65
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:38,310
Who are you?

66
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:39,561
A stupid boy.

67
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,893
I am Dickon Tarly,

68
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:44,310
son of Randyll Tarly.

69
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:46,518
You are the future
of your house.

70
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,893
This war has already wiped one
great house from the world.

71
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:51,769
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

72
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:00,894
I will not.

73
00:08:05,227 --> 00:08:08,934
Your Grace, nothing scrubs
bold notions from a man's head

74
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:10,518
like a few weeks in a dark cell.

75
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,184
I meant what I said.

76
00:08:13,185 --> 00:08:14,727
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

77
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,059
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

78
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,436
I gave them a choice.

79
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:21,268
They made it.

80
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:24,435
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families...

81
00:08:24,436 --> 00:08:26,603
I'm not beheading anyone.

82
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,436
Your Grace.

83
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,310
Lord Randyll
Tarly, Dickon Tarly,

84
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:03,976
I, Daenerys of House
Targaryen, First of My Name,

85
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:07,101
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

86
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:08,935
sentence you to die.

87
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,686
Dracarys.

88
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:03,227
My... my lord...

89
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,728
How many men did we lose?

90
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,352
We haven't done
a full accounting.

91
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,518
It's not only armies
that win wars.

92
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,018
We have the Tyrell gold, we
have the Iron Bank behind us.

93
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:28,686
We can buy mercenaries.

94
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,476
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

95
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:34,685
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

96
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:38,143
I just saw the Dothraki fight.

97
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,768
They'll beat any mercenary army.

98
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:41,852
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

99
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:44,727
Killing our men wasn't war
for them, it was sport.

100
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,934
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

101
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,184
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

102
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:51,728
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

103
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,685
This isn't a war we can win.

104
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,060
So, what do we do?

105
00:10:58,477 --> 00:10:59,728
Sue for peace?

106
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,643
I sit on her father's throne,

107
00:11:02,644 --> 00:11:05,310
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

108
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:08,143
And in her mind, she's winning.

109
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:10,227
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

110
00:11:12,686 --> 00:11:16,101
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

111
00:11:16,102 --> 00:11:18,477
by way of apology for
murdering our father and son.

112
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,727
He didn't.

113
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:23,727
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

114
00:11:23,728 --> 00:11:25,602
I'm not talking about Father.

115
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:29,143
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

116
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:32,436
- After all this time, it still amazes me that you...
- It was Olenna.

117
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,144
She confessed before she died.

118
00:11:39,436 --> 00:11:41,685
And this was before or after

119
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,768
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

120
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,393
After.

121
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:47,893
And you believed her?

122
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,643
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

123
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,311
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

124
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:58,059
Which one would Margaery have
been better able to control?

125
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,602
Which one would have made Olenna

126
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:02,310
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

127
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:04,185
She was telling the truth.

128
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,769
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

129
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:17,351
She should have died screaming.

130
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,643
She's dead, like her son,

131
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:20,727
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

132
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:24,310
And if we don't find a way out
of this war, we'll follow them.

133
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,852
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

134
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:29,018
I know my choice.

135
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,519
A soldier should know his.

136
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,810
They're beautiful, aren't they?

137
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:43,603
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

138
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:47,602
but, yes, they are.

139
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:49,101
Gorgeous beasts.

140
00:14:49,102 --> 00:14:51,018
They're not beasts to me.

141
00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:52,852
No matter how big they get

142
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:55,018
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

143
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,644
they're my children.

144
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:03,643
You weren't gone long.

145
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:05,810
No.

146
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:07,810
And?

147
00:15:07,811 --> 00:15:10,519
And I have fewer enemies
today than I did yesterday.

148
00:15:13,185 --> 00:15:15,268
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

149
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:16,977
No, I'm not.

150
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,351
How many men did your army kill

151
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,352
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

152
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,893
Thousands.

153
00:15:24,894 --> 00:15:27,018
We both want to help people.

154
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,727
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

155
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:32,811
Sometimes strength is terrible.

156
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,685
When you first came here,

157
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:42,435
Ser Davos said you took a knife
in the heart for your people.

158
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,060
Ser Davos gets carried away.

159
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,518
So, it was a figure of speech?

160
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,380
_

161
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,483
_

162
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,259
Your Grace.

163
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:18,476
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

164
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,727
an old friend.

165
00:16:20,728 --> 00:16:22,226
I served with your father.

166
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:24,394
He was a great man.

167
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:27,603
You look strong.

168
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:30,768
You found a cure?

169
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:32,727
I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

170
00:16:32,728 --> 00:16:37,226
I return to your
service, my queen,

171
00:16:37,227 --> 00:16:39,018
if you'll have me.

172
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:41,394
It would be my honor.

173
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:22,310
Ravens.

174
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,144
We need to send ravens.

175
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:29,351
I put very little stock
in it myself.

176
00:18:29,352 --> 00:18:31,810
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

177
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,018
especially when winter comes.

178
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,351
I remember Wolkan.

179
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:38,727
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

180
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:42,226
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

181
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,435
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

182
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:46,226
or the company.

183
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:48,393
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

184
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,518
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

185
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,685
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

186
00:18:53,686 --> 00:18:55,351
Yes, it is a bit much.

187
00:18:55,352 --> 00:18:58,060
- Still, we ought to write back...
- Brandon Stark.

188
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:04,728
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

189
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,059
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

190
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,226
I saw him go beyond the Wall.

191
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,810
And?

192
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,727
Somehow, a crippled boy

193
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:17,810
survived for years beyond the
Wall when no one else could.

194
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:21,561
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

195
00:19:23,185 --> 00:19:25,268
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

196
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,393
Perhaps you need more scribing
work to discipline your mind.

197
00:19:28,394 --> 00:19:31,811
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

198
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:46,435
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

199
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:50,602
If you tell people the threat
is real, they'll believe it.

200
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,976
If you advise all the lords
to send their men north

201
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,934
to hold the Wall, they'll do it.

202
00:19:54,935 --> 00:19:58,435
And if you tell every
maester in the Citadel

203
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,768
to search every word
of every faded scroll

204
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:02,560
about the Long Night,

205
00:20:02,561 --> 00:20:04,393
they may find something
that lets us defeat

206
00:20:04,394 --> 00:20:06,311
the Army of the Dead for good.

207
00:20:11,394 --> 00:20:12,603
It could be done.

208
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:16,810
And this news
could be authentic.

209
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:18,477
It's possible.

210
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:23,310
It's also possible
that this message

211
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,602
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

212
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:28,560
to lure southern armies away from the
lands they are currently defending

213
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,602
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

214
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,310
That does
seem far more likely

215
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,268
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

216
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,810
Archmaester, please.

217
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:37,977
It's real.

218
00:20:39,894 --> 00:20:40,977
I've seen it.

219
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:45,310
We will write to Maester Wolkan

220
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:47,685
at Winterfell for clarification.

221
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:50,560
I promise you we will get to the
truth of it one way or another.

222
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:53,268
- Archmaester, please...
- That will be all, Tarly.

223
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:55,768
It brings to mind the
work of Jenny of Oldstones,

224
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:58,393
the charlatan who claimed descent
from the children of the forest.

225
00:20:58,394 --> 00:21:01,184
Don't forget the prophet Lodos,

226
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:04,852
who promised that the Drowned God would
rise up and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

227
00:21:04,853 --> 00:21:07,144
Ah, Lodos.

228
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,976
Is he the one whose father and
brother were just burnt alive?

229
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:16,934
I'm afraid so.

230
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:18,184
Horrible business.

231
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,810
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

232
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,852
He's a good lad.

233
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,602
Right.

234
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:27,518
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

235
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:35,351
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

236
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:36,561
That's why they're rulers.

237
00:21:39,686 --> 00:21:41,685
She gave Tarly a choice,

238
00:21:41,686 --> 00:21:44,518
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

239
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,268
What else could she do?

240
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:49,393
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

241
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,727
I am her Hand, not her head.

242
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,976
I can't make
her decisions for her.

243
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:57,268
That's what I used to tell
myself about her father.

244
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:01,643
I found the traitors, but I wasn't
the one burning them alive.

245
00:22:01,644 --> 00:22:04,394
I was only a purveyor
of information.

246
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,602
It's what I told myself when I
watched them beg for mercy...

247
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:16,184
I'm not the one doing it.

248
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,643
When the pitch of their
screams rose higher...

249
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:20,685
I'm not the one doing it.

250
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,268
When their hair caught fire

251
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:25,143
and the smell of their burning
flesh filled the throne room...

252
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,769
I'm not the one doing it.

253
00:22:35,436 --> 00:22:37,643
Daenerys is not her father.

254
00:22:37,644 --> 00:22:40,059
And she never will be

255
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,102
with the right counsel.

256
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,769
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

257
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:53,602
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

258
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,143
Did you read it?

259
00:22:55,144 --> 00:22:58,185
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

260
00:23:04,311 --> 00:23:05,769
What's it say?

261
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:08,436
Nothing good.

262
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,310
I thought Arya was dead.

263
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:21,393
I thought Bran was dead.

264
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:22,811
I'm happy for you.

265
00:23:25,185 --> 00:23:26,602
You don't look happy.

266
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:28,976
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

267
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:30,977
marching towards Eastwatch.

268
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,560
If they make it past the Wall...

269
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:37,268
The Wall has kept them out for
thousands of years, presumably.

270
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:38,934
I need to go home.

271
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:40,643
You said you don't
have enough men.

272
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:43,226
We'll fight
with the men we have.

273
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:44,852
Unless you'll join us.

274
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:47,018
And give the country to Cersei?

275
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:50,852
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

276
00:23:50,853 --> 00:23:53,184
Perhaps not.

277
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:56,602
Cersei thinks the Army of the
Dead is nothing but a story

278
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:59,852
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

279
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,602
What if we prove her wrong?

280
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:05,019
I don't think she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

281
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,352
So bring the dead to her.

282
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:11,685
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

283
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:14,059
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

284
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,101
Only one soldier.

285
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:18,019
Is that possible?

286
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:23,560
The first wight I ever saw

287
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:26,393
was brought into Castle
Black from beyond the Wall.

288
00:24:26,394 --> 00:24:28,727
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

289
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:31,018
and show her the truth.

290
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,059
Anything you bring back
will be useless

291
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,893
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

292
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:37,435
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

293
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:39,685
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

294
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,268
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

295
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:45,102
He might listen to me.

296
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:50,935
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

297
00:24:57,102 --> 00:24:58,934
I can smuggle you in,

298
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:01,560
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

299
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:04,768
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

300
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,184
Well, it will all be for nothing

301
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:07,976
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

302
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,351
Fair point.

303
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:10,644
How do you propose to find one?

304
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,269
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

305
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:22,310
You asked me to find a
cure so I could serve you.

306
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,935
Allow me to serve you.

307
00:25:27,935 --> 00:25:29,435
The Free Folk will help us.

308
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:32,184
They know the real north
better than anyone.

309
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:33,727
They won't follow Ser Jorah.

310
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:34,935
They won't have to.

311
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:44,393
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

312
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:47,018
You're not in the Night's Watch
anymore, you're King in the North.

313
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:49,602
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

314
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:51,977
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

315
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,352
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

316
00:25:58,185 --> 00:26:01,560
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

317
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:02,769
I am a king.

318
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:05,810
And I came here

319
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,643
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

320
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:10,852
or your dragons burn me alive.

321
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:15,268
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

322
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:18,268
because I knew it was the
best chance for my people,

323
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,436
for all our people.

324
00:26:21,977 --> 00:26:26,311
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

325
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,519
because it's our best chance.

326
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,853
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

327
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:59,768
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

328
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:02,603
But perhaps we should have.

329
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:09,893
The Knights of the Vale came
here for you, Lady Stark.

330
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,352
Aye.

331
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:19,226
You are very kind, my lords.

332
00:27:19,227 --> 00:27:21,268
But Jon is our king.

333
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:23,810
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

334
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,768
I warned Jon
this would happen.

335
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:37,435
That he couldn't leave the North

336
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:40,268
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

337
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:42,643
He didn't. He trusted
you to hold it for him.

338
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,436
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

339
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:52,393
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

340
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:53,935
And?

341
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,976
Nothing.

342
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,768
Don't do that.

343
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:04,269
- What?
- Say what you mean.

344
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,394
You always liked nice things.

345
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:12,102
They made you feel
better than everyone.

346
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:18,602
Are you angry with me?

347
00:28:18,603 --> 00:28:20,934
They were insulting Jon,

348
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:22,310
and you sat there and listened.

349
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,810
I listened to their complaints,

350
00:28:23,811 --> 00:28:26,852
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

351
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:29,810
Their opinions
are important to you.

352
00:28:29,811 --> 00:28:32,518
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

353
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,476
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

354
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:37,477
Not if they lose
their heads first.

355
00:28:40,935 --> 00:28:44,101
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

356
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:45,976
We took it back,

357
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:47,934
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

358
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,393
and the wildlings and the Vale.

359
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,934
All of us, working together.

360
00:28:50,935 --> 00:28:55,268
Now, I'm sure cutting off
heads is very satisfying,

361
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:58,811
but that's not the way you
get people to work together.

362
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:04,268
And if Jon doesn't come back,

363
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,226
you'll need their support...

364
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:08,351
so you can work together

365
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:10,310
to give you
what you really want.

366
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:12,894
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

367
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:17,644
You're thinking it right now.

368
00:29:19,644 --> 00:29:22,602
You don't want to be,

369
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:24,894
but the thought
just won't go away.

370
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,686
I have work to do.

371
00:29:36,352 --> 00:29:37,644
My lady.

372
00:29:49,686 --> 00:29:52,934
Last time I was here, I killed
my father with a crossbow.

373
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:55,894
Last time I was here, you
killed my son with wildfire.

374
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,893
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

375
00:30:01,894 --> 00:30:04,560
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

376
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:05,935
Too many steps.

377
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:12,101
You're not staying here?

378
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:15,602
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

379
00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:17,435
What if someone takes the boat?

380
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:19,728
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

381
00:30:25,144 --> 00:30:26,560
We don't have time for this.

382
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,727
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

383
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:29,893
The Dothraki are coming.

384
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:32,018
All the more reason
for you to train.

385
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:34,018
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

386
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:36,560
Well, I seem to recall them giving
you a bit of trouble as well.

387
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:38,560
And here I am, ready to train.

388
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:40,518
Why down here?

389
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,351
I don't think
you want people to see

390
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:45,268
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

391
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:48,059
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

392
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,603
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

393
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:00,477
I'll leave you to it.

394
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:05,603
I needed to see you.

395
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,894
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

396
00:31:12,436 --> 00:31:15,393
You made me look
like a complete fool.

397
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:17,685
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

398
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:20,643
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

399
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:23,226
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

400
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:24,727
Father would have been proud.

401
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:26,476
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me...

402
00:31:26,477 --> 00:31:27,976
I once told Bronn

403
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:30,811
that if I ever saw you
again, I'd cut you in half.

404
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,311
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

405
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:47,393
He was going to execute me.

406
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:50,101
He knew I was innocent.

407
00:31:50,102 --> 00:31:52,435
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

408
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,810
he hated me
because of what I am.

409
00:31:54,811 --> 00:31:57,977
A little monster
sent to punish him.

410
00:31:59,853 --> 00:32:02,059
Did he...
did he think...

411
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,852
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

412
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:05,733
- Did he think I chose it...
- What do you want?!

413
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:13,811
Daenerys will win this war.

414
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,602
You're a military man.

415
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,352
You must know there's
no way around that.

416
00:32:22,394 --> 00:32:23,976
Daenerys is not her father.

417
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:26,852
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

418
00:32:26,853 --> 00:32:29,352
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

419
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,893
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

420
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:33,351
you can ask her yourself.

421
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,728
I... I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

422
00:32:37,144 --> 00:32:38,853
Not right now, anyway.

423
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:43,269
She has a more
important request.

424
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:24,977
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

425
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:34,268
Thought you might
still be rowing.

426
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:40,976
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

427
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,268
Should have known to come
straight to the Street of Steel.

428
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,768
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

429
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:48,184
Haven't been here in years.

430
00:33:48,185 --> 00:33:50,602
Why should they recognize me?

431
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:53,269
Sometimes I hardly do.

432
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,102
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

433
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:03,976
Anybody give you any trouble?

434
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:06,435
Here I am, arming Lannisters,

435
00:34:06,436 --> 00:34:08,310
and I never get a second look.

436
00:34:08,311 --> 00:34:09,810
But you were right.

437
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:12,351
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

438
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,852
Don't be so sure.

439
00:34:13,853 --> 00:34:16,769
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

440
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:20,519
Bad things are coming.

441
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:26,240
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

442
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,399
Well, the thing you need to
understand is...

443
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,089
I'm ready.

444
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:29,560
- You...
- Let's go.

445
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,476
You should know
what you're heading into.

446
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:33,476
What do you think
I've been thinking about

447
00:34:33,477 --> 00:34:34,852
with every swing of the hammer?

448
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:37,310
How happy I am making weapons

449
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,768
for the family
that killed my father?

450
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:41,476
The family that
tried to kill me?

451
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:45,852
I've been getting ready.

452
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,310
I never knew what for,

453
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:49,853
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

454
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,602
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

455
00:34:54,603 --> 00:34:56,519
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

456
00:34:58,019 --> 00:34:59,352
But this...

457
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:02,519
this I know.

458
00:35:11,603 --> 00:35:13,018
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

459
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:15,811
Situation's complicated
enough already.

460
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:18,853
Well, who should I say I am?

461
00:35:22,686 --> 00:35:25,101
I told you, Clovis, if we
don't get out of here soon,

462
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:26,942
- someone's going to...
- You there!

463
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,561
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

464
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:34,226
What can I do for you?

465
00:35:34,227 --> 00:35:36,727
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

466
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:39,143
- The docks are that way.
- That they are.

467
00:35:39,144 --> 00:35:40,643
I try to stay away from them

468
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:42,894
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

469
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,893
- Still five gold dragons?
- Are you joking?

470
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:51,143
You must be even older
than you look.

471
00:35:51,144 --> 00:35:53,059
- 15.
- 15?!

472
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,185
Apiece.

473
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:04,728
I can't say it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

474
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:08,603
What's in the boat?

475
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:15,310
Not more gold.

476
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:17,059
- Wine?
- Mm.

477
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

478
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:22,102
Come have a look.

479
00:36:30,644 --> 00:36:32,560
- Fermented crab.
- What?

480
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:34,435
Fermented crab.

481
00:36:34,436 --> 00:36:37,435
One bucket of this triples a
brothel's earnings for the week.

482
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,393
A man thinks he's done.

483
00:36:39,394 --> 00:36:41,976
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

484
00:36:41,977 --> 00:36:43,893
But before he gets
his breeches up,

485
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:47,268
his lady of the hour pops a tiny
spoon of that into his mouth.

486
00:36:47,269 --> 00:36:50,810
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

487
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:53,311
Here, have a taste.

488
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,852
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

489
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:10,351
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

490
00:37:37,352 --> 00:37:39,352
Oi, dwarf!

491
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:42,226
I really wouldn't try any more

492
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:44,268
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

493
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:46,143
That dwarf...

494
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:47,768
Where'd you get that scar?

495
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:50,310
Fish hook. Some men
you just can't teach.

496
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,393
We was looking for a dwarf with
a scar like that a while back.

497
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,435
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

498
00:37:57,853 --> 00:37:59,810
Arrangement?

499
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:03,018
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei...

500
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:12,560
This is Gendry.

501
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:14,060
He'll do.

502
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:17,769
Go, go, go.

503
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:22,059
I could give you something.

504
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,561
That won't be necessary.

505
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,227
Ser Jaime.

506
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,728
Why was Qyburn here?

507
00:38:40,144 --> 00:38:42,394
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

508
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,603
I met with Tyrion.

509
00:38:57,477 --> 00:39:00,227
What did our brother
have to say?

510
00:39:02,811 --> 00:39:05,268
Daenerys wants to meet.

511
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:07,893
To discuss her surrender?

512
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:09,727
To discuss an armistice.

513
00:39:09,728 --> 00:39:12,518
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

514
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,268
Because an army of dead men

515
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,811
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

516
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:21,143
Tyrion claims he'll have proof.

517
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:27,393
- Are you going to punish him?
- Tyrion?

518
00:39:27,394 --> 00:39:28,894
Bronn.

519
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,810
He betrayed you.

520
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:36,185
He set up a meeting without
your knowledge or consent.

521
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,310
Do you think
anything of importance

522
00:39:41,311 --> 00:39:43,810
happens in this city
without me knowing?

523
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:47,059
You let it happen.
Why?

524
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,727
I've come to believe that

525
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:52,435
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

526
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:54,976
could be in our
immediate interest.

527
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,310
She has the numbers. If we want to
beat her, we have to be clever.

528
00:39:58,311 --> 00:40:00,477
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

529
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:07,102
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

530
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:12,143
Whatever stands in our way,

531
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:13,893
we will defeat it.

532
00:40:13,894 --> 00:40:16,685
For ourselves, for our house,

533
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:18,686
for this.

534
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:32,893
Who will you say is the father?

535
00:40:32,894 --> 00:40:34,185
You.

536
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,352
People won't like that.

537
00:40:44,977 --> 00:40:49,393
Do you remember what Father
used to say about people?

538
00:40:49,394 --> 00:40:53,352
The lion does not concern himself
with the opinions of the sheep.

539
00:41:07,269 --> 00:41:09,227
Never betray me again.

540
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:16,226
We're leaving today.

541
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:19,810
- The king's got a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

542
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,393
He doesn't need to be thinking about
harboring the bastard of a dead king.

543
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:24,852
- You don't have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

544
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:27,184
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

545
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:30,184
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

546
00:41:30,185 --> 00:41:32,184
Understood.

547
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:35,810
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

548
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:37,268
You survived King's Landing.

549
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:40,268
Yet again. Your
Grace, this is Clo...

550
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:42,685
Name's Gendry, Your Grace.

551
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:44,268
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

552
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,394
Bastard son.

553
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:50,934
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

554
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,768
Our fathers trusted each other.

555
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:54,102
Why shouldn't we?

556
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,893
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

557
00:41:58,894 --> 00:42:02,102
I met yours in my shop.

558
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:06,144
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

559
00:42:16,227 --> 00:42:20,018
I grew up on stories about them.

560
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:23,019
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

561
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:27,560
Ser Davos told me where you're
going, Your Grace, and why.

562
00:42:27,561 --> 00:42:29,351
Let me come with you.

563
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:31,226
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

564
00:42:31,227 --> 00:42:33,059
No, but I'm a fighter.

565
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,144
And he won't be needing a
smith with a sword like that.

566
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:40,059
You know how to use one?

567
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,435
Well, that's a problem.

568
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,977
I prefer a hammer.

569
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:48,686
He can handle himself.

570
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:52,560
We could use the help.

571
00:42:52,561 --> 00:42:54,435
As my father used to say,

572
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,518
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

573
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,768
than dead for
the rest of your life."

574
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:01,184
I owe you my life.

575
00:43:01,185 --> 00:43:02,976
Twice over.

576
00:43:02,977 --> 00:43:06,226
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

577
00:43:06,227 --> 00:43:08,686
I can't wait out this war.

578
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:14,393
Yeah, nobody mind me.

579
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:18,435
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

580
00:43:18,436 --> 00:43:20,351
All right, come on.

581
00:43:29,935 --> 00:43:32,184
You may not believe it,

582
00:43:32,185 --> 00:43:34,893
but I've missed you, Mormont.

583
00:43:34,894 --> 00:43:38,018
Nobody glowers quite like you.

584
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:39,311
Not even Grey Worm.

585
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:47,059
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

586
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,059
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

587
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,894
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

588
00:43:58,352 --> 00:43:59,728
Take it with you.

589
00:44:02,394 --> 00:44:03,893
But bring it back.

590
00:44:03,894 --> 00:44:05,060
Our queen needs you.

591
00:44:14,436 --> 00:44:16,894
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

592
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:20,060
Your Grace, I...

593
00:44:37,477 --> 00:44:39,727
If I don't return, at least
you won't have to deal

594
00:44:39,728 --> 00:44:41,088
with the King
in the North anymore.

595
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:45,269
I've grown used to him.

596
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,977
I wish you good fortune in the
wars to come, Your Grace.

597
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,728
Heave!

598
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:28,310
Do you know how many
steps there are in the Citadel?

599
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,518
No.

600
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,477
15,782.

601
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,477
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

602
00:45:42,603 --> 00:45:45,143
None anymore.

603
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:46,810
That's true.

604
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:51,143
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

605
00:45:51,144 --> 00:45:53,352
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

606
00:45:56,894 --> 00:46:00,101
What does "annulment" mean?

607
00:46:00,102 --> 00:46:03,976
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

608
00:46:03,977 --> 00:46:09,351
Maynard says here that he issued
an annulment for a Prince "Ragger"

609
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:12,852
and remarried him to someone
else at the same time

610
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,393
in a secret ceremony in Dorne.

611
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:17,310
Is that a common thing
in the south or...?

612
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:18,686
These maesters...

613
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:24,143
they set me to the task of preserving
that man's window counting

614
00:46:24,144 --> 00:46:26,435
and annulments and bowel
movements for all eternity,

615
00:46:26,436 --> 00:46:28,226
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

616
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:30,893
probably sitting on some dusty shelf
somewhere, completely ignored.

617
00:46:30,894 --> 00:46:32,810
But that's all right, isn't it?

618
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:36,893
We can all become slavering, murderous
imbeciles in thrall to evil incarnate

619
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,518
as long as we can have access
to the full records

620
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,561
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

621
00:46:44,894 --> 00:46:46,519
Steps.

622
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:51,686
That number was the steps.

623
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:16,226
Are you sure
you want to do this?

624
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,644
You always wanted
to be a maester.

625
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:24,436
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

626
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,394
I found it, my lord.

627
00:49:59,102 --> 00:50:00,810
It, uh, took some searching.

628
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:02,894
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

629
00:50:07,603 --> 00:50:10,226
You're sure this is the
only copy in Winterfell?

630
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:12,102
Uh, yes, my lord.

631
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:18,811
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

632
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,810
Isn't it your
job to talk him out

633
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:54,810
of stupid fucking
ideas like this?

634
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:57,603
I've been failing
at that job of late.

635
00:52:59,227 --> 00:53:01,268
How many queens are there now?

636
00:53:01,269 --> 00:53:02,602
Two.

637
00:53:02,603 --> 00:53:05,768
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

638
00:53:05,769 --> 00:53:07,602
or the one who
fucks her brother?

639
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,436
Both.

640
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,477
How many men did you bring?

641
00:53:15,561 --> 00:53:17,101
Not enough.

642
00:53:17,102 --> 00:53:18,728
The big woman?

643
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,852
We were hoping some of
your men could help.

644
00:53:24,853 --> 00:53:27,685
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

645
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:30,810
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

646
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,811
You are.

647
00:53:34,603 --> 00:53:37,811
You really want to go out there?
Again?

648
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:45,853
You're not the only ones.

649
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:52,976
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

650
00:53:52,977 --> 00:53:54,853
Said they were
on their way here.

651
00:54:01,686 --> 00:54:03,144
You're the Hound.

652
00:54:05,144 --> 00:54:06,977
I saw you once at Winterfell.

653
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:14,852
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

654
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:18,143
We don't want to go beyond
the Wall, we have to.

655
00:54:18,144 --> 00:54:20,310
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming...

656
00:54:20,311 --> 00:54:22,518
Don't trust him.

657
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,477
Don't trust any of them.

658
00:54:30,102 --> 00:54:31,727
They're the Brotherhood.

659
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:34,310
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

660
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:36,685
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

661
00:54:36,686 --> 00:54:38,394
Thoros?

662
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:45,518
I hardly recognized you.

663
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:47,727
Ser Jorah Mormont.

664
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:50,685
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

665
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:53,727
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

666
00:54:53,728 --> 00:54:56,560
You're a fucking Mormont?

667
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:58,685
Like the last Lord Commander?

668
00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:00,893
He was my father.

669
00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:03,893
He hunted us like animals.

670
00:55:03,894 --> 00:55:06,934
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

671
00:55:08,603 --> 00:55:11,226
Here we all are

672
00:55:11,227 --> 00:55:12,810
at the edge of the world

673
00:55:12,811 --> 00:55:14,393
at the same moment,

674
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,894
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

675
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,976
Our reasons aren't your reasons.

676
00:55:20,977 --> 00:55:23,352
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

677
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:27,351
There's a greater
purpose at work.

678
00:55:27,352 --> 00:55:30,643
And we serve it together,

679
00:55:30,644 --> 00:55:32,934
whether we know it or not.

680
00:55:32,935 --> 00:55:35,852
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light...

681
00:55:35,853 --> 00:55:39,226
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

682
00:55:39,227 --> 00:55:42,018
Are we coming with you or not?

683
00:55:42,019 --> 00:55:44,226
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

684
00:55:44,227 --> 00:55:48,643
Is it worse than sitting in a
freezing cell, waiting to die?

685
00:55:48,644 --> 00:55:50,643
He's right.

686
00:55:50,644 --> 00:55:52,644
We're all on the same side.

687
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,269
How can we be?

688
00:55:57,894 --> 00:55:59,977
We're all breathing.

689
00:57:10,236 --> 00:57:20,921

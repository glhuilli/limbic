3
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,570
- You all right?
- Mm.

4
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:39,779
Ever been north before?

5
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,445
Never seen snow before.

6
00:02:41,446 --> 00:02:43,320
Beautiful, eh?

7
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,862
I can breathe again.

8
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:47,029
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

9
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,654
You've never been down south.

10
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:50,570
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

11
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:54,112
How do you live up here?

12
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,987
How do you keep your
balls from freezing off?

13
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:58,487
You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

14
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:02,529
Walking's good, fighting's
better, fucking's best.

15
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,987
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

16
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:08,363
We have to make do with what we've got.

17
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,570
This one is maybe not so smart.

18
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,487
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

19
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:21,987
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

20
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:25,196
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

21
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:30,029
So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?

22
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,403
And?

23
00:03:31,404 --> 00:03:34,779
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

24
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,195
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

25
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,905
Now you don't like kneeling.

26
00:03:41,863 --> 00:03:44,195
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

27
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:46,029
A proud man.

28
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,863
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

29
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,863
How many of his people
died for his pride?

30
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:10,195
You still mad at us, boy?

31
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:12,237
You sold me to a witch.

32
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,654
A priestess.

33
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,570
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

34
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:19,737
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

35
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,612
I wanted to be one of you.

36
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:24,654
I wanted to join the
Brotherhood, but you sold me off

37
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,612
like a slave.

38
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:28,612
Do you know what she did to me?

39
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,195
She strapped me down on a bed,

40
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:33,029
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

41
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,779
- and put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

42
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,237
She needed your blood.

43
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,904
Yes, thank you. I know that.

44
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:41,862
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

45
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:43,898
They would have killed
me if wasn't for Davos.

46
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,863
But they didn't, did they?

47
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,779
So, what you whinging about?

48
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,445
I'm not whinging.

49
00:04:49,446 --> 00:04:52,403
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

50
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,445
That's whinging.

51
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:56,237
This one's been killed six times.

52
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:57,947
You don't hear him bitching about it.

53
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,571
Good lad.

54
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,779
The first time I went north of
the Wall was with your father.

55
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,403
He was a good man.

56
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:22,529
He deserved a better son.

57
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,570
Were you with him at the end?

58
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:27,654
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

59
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,654
But we avenged him.

60
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:31,153
I want you to know that.

61
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,153
Every mutineer found justice.

62
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:36,987
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

63
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:38,487
The Night's Watch was his life.

64
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,320
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

65
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,779
And they butchered him.

66
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,987
I hate that he died that way.

67
00:05:45,988 --> 00:05:48,654
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

68
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:51,445
He was good all the way through.

69
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:54,695
And he died on the executioner's block.

70
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:58,862
Your father wanted to
execute me, you know?

71
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,403
I heard.

72
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:02,695
He was in the right, of course.

73
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,195
Didn't make me hate him any less.

74
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:08,196
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

75
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:18,445
Your father gave me this sword.

76
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:21,988
Changed the pommel from
a bear to a wolf...

77
00:06:25,655 --> 00:06:27,238
but it's still Longclaw.

78
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,529
Lord Commander Mormont

79
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,154
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

80
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:42,029
But you are back,

81
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,987
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

82
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,780
It's not right for me to have it.

83
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:53,362
He gave it to you.

84
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,571
I'm not his son.

85
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,738
I brought shame onto my house.

86
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:07,446
I broke my father's heart.

87
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:12,738
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

88
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:16,570
It's yours.

89
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:18,696
May it serve you well...

90
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,738
and your children after you.

91
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:50,445
Father used to watch us from up here.

92
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,946
He wouldn't say much.

93
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:54,320
You probably don't remember.

94
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,321
You were inside knitting all the time.

95
00:07:57,655 --> 00:07:59,072
I remember.

96
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:04,154
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

97
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,779
I came out here after,

98
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,029
and Bran had left his bow behind,

99
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,654
just lying on the ground.

100
00:08:12,655 --> 00:08:15,030
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

101
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,612
There was one arrow in the target.

102
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:24,278
There was no one around, just like now.

103
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,154
No one to stop me.

104
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:29,779
So I started shooting.

105
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,153
And every shot, I had to go up there

106
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:35,446
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

107
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,696
I wasn't very good.

108
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,237
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

109
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:45,654
Could have been the
20th shot or the 50th.

110
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,112
I don't remember.

111
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:50,530
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

112
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:54,445
I looked up,

113
00:08:54,446 --> 00:08:56,195
and he's standing right here,

114
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:57,863
smiling down at me.

115
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:03,445
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

116
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:07,862
But he was smiling, so I
knew it wasn't wrong.

117
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,404
The rules were wrong.

118
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:14,072
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

119
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,696
Now he's dead.

120
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,445
Killed by the Lannisters

121
00:09:22,446 --> 00:09:24,072
with your help.

122
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:29,138
What?

123
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:40,946
That's your pretty handwriting.

124
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,779
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

125
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,530
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

126
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:50,570
"Robb, I write to you
today with heavy heart.

127
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:52,737
Our good King Robert is dead,

128
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:54,570
killed from wounds he
took in a boar hunt."

129
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:56,071
You don't have to read it. I remember.

130
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,779
"Father has been charged with treason.

131
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,737
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

132
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,570
and tried to steal his throne.

133
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:04,403
The Lannisters are treating me well

134
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,403
and providing me with every comfort.

135
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,737
I beg you, come to King's Landing,

136
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,612
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

137
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,821
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

138
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,612
of Lannister and Stark.

139
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:16,821
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

140
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,237
They forced me to do it.

141
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,403
Did they?

142
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:22,695
With a knife at your throat?

143
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:24,153
Did they put you on a
rack and stretch you

144
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,862
until your bones started to pop?

145
00:10:25,863 --> 00:10:27,779
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

146
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,612
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

147
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,445
They told me it was the
only way to save Father.

148
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,988
And you were stupid
enough to believe them.

149
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,946
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

150
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:43,654
when they dragged Father to the block.

151
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,278
I remember the pretty
dress you were wearing.

152
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,655
I remember the fancy
way you did your hair.

153
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:50,612
You were there?

154
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:51,904
I was there.

155
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:54,779
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

156
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,570
And what did you do?

157
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:58,987
Did you come running to the rescue?

158
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:01,779
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

159
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,403
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

160
00:11:04,404 --> 00:11:06,987
I didn't betray him. I
didn't betray Robb.

161
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:10,655
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

162
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,987
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

163
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:19,862
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

164
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,071
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

165
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,153
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

166
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,904
The Knights of the Vale won the battle,

167
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,529
and they rode north for me.

168
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,821
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

169
00:11:30,822 --> 00:11:33,654
- I was training.
- Training.

170
00:11:33,655 --> 00:11:35,529
Well, while you were training,

171
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,779
I suffered things you
could never imagine.

172
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,404
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

173
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:46,153
You never would have
survived what I survived.

174
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:48,738
I guess we'll never know.

175
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,696
What are you going to
do with that letter?

176
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:57,655
I don't know yet.

177
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,987
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

178
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,071
You're scared, aren't you?

179
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:06,195
What are you scared of?

180
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,195
You didn't commit any crimes.

181
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:10,029
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

182
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,487
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

183
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,862
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

184
00:12:15,863 --> 00:12:17,821
You were just a scared little girl,

185
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,029
all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

186
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,904
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

187
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:25,904
This is exactly what she wants.

188
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,987
This is what she's always wanted...
to tear us apart.

189
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:30,571
You're scared the Northern
lords will read it.

190
00:12:32,072 --> 00:12:33,779
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

191
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,779
if they knew how she
did Cersei's bidding.

192
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:39,779
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

193
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,946
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

194
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:45,446
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

195
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,029
You're angry.

196
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,237
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

197
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:55,863
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

198
00:12:57,863 --> 00:12:59,738
I'll go with anger.

199
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:32,654
You're the one they call "the Dog."

200
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:34,487
Fuck off.

201
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,278
They told me you were mean.

202
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,695
Were you born mean or
you just hate wildings?

203
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:41,071
I don't give two shits about wildings.

204
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:42,779
It's gingers I hate.

205
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,654
Gingers are beautiful.

206
00:13:44,655 --> 00:13:48,237
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

207
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:51,154
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

208
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:58,529
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

209
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,278
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

210
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,195
And ever since, you've been mean.

211
00:14:02,196 --> 00:14:03,821
Will you fuck off?

212
00:14:03,822 --> 00:14:05,779
I don't think you're truly mean.

213
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,321
You have sad eyes.

214
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:10,320
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

215
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:13,029
- Dick?
- Cock.

216
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,029
Ah, dick.

217
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,320
I like it.

218
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,362
I bet you do.

219
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:20,987
Nope, it's pussy for me.

220
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,987
I have a beauty waiting for
me back at Winterfell.

221
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,112
If I ever get back there.

222
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:28,862
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

223
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,071
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

224
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:32,530
Almost as tall as you.

225
00:14:34,696 --> 00:14:36,862
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

226
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:39,195
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

227
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:41,570
Well, not with her yet.

228
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:45,195
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

229
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:47,654
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

230
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,403
You do know her.

231
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:50,862
We've met.

232
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:52,987
I want to make babies with her.

233
00:14:52,988 --> 00:14:55,987
Think of them... great big monsters.

234
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,570
They'd conquer the world.

235
00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:01,153
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

236
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:02,905
I'm good at killing people.

237
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,445
You don't look much like him.

238
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:08,904
Who's that?

239
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:10,946
Your father.

240
00:15:10,947 --> 00:15:13,029
I suppose you favor your mother.

241
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,403
You knew him?

242
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,195
'Course I did.

243
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:18,779
When he was Hand,

244
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,153
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

245
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,612
Your wildling friend told me

246
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,904
the red woman brought you back.

247
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:29,071
Thoros has brought me back six times.

248
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:32,153
We both serve the same lord.

249
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:34,071
I serve the North.

250
00:15:34,072 --> 00:15:36,112
The North didn't raise
you from the dead.

251
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:38,112
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

252
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,487
I don't know anything about him.

253
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,112
I don't know what he wants from me.

254
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,487
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

255
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,904
I don't know.

256
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,278
That's all anyone can tell me...
"I don't know."

257
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,112
So, what's the point in serving a god

258
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:54,612
if none of us knows what he wants?

259
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:57,320
I think about that all the time.

260
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,403
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

261
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:03,779
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

262
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,445
We have to know what we're fighting for.

263
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:09,654
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

264
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:12,695
can sit on a throne made of swords.

265
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,112
So, what are you fighting for?

266
00:16:15,113 --> 00:16:16,513
Life.

267
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,612
Death is the enemy.

268
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:22,905
The first enemy and the last.

269
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:26,138
But we all die.

270
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:30,153
The enemy always wins.

271
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,403
And we still need to fight him.

272
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,362
That's all I know.

273
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:37,821
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

274
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:40,071
but we can keep others alive.

275
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:42,863
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

276
00:16:46,154 --> 00:16:49,071
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

277
00:16:49,072 --> 00:16:52,904
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

278
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,112
Maybe that's enough.

279
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:56,513
Aye.

280
00:16:58,072 --> 00:16:59,822
Maybe that's enough.

281
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:10,196
That's what I saw in the fire.

282
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,404
A mountain like an arrowhead.

283
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,738
Are you sure?

284
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,196
We're getting close.

285
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,196
Do you know what I like about you?

286
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:36,695
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

287
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:38,237
Oh.

288
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:41,029
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

289
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,821
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

290
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:45,612
I don't want you to be a hero.

291
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:48,904
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

292
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:50,946
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

293
00:17:50,947 --> 00:17:54,237
even this... Jon Snow...

294
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:56,904
they all try to outdo each other.

295
00:17:56,905 --> 00:17:59,071
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

296
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:02,071
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

297
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:04,278
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

298
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,195
even this... Jon Snow.

299
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,320
They all fell in love with you.

300
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,278
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

301
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,987
I suppose he stares at you longingly

302
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:16,905
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

303
00:18:20,404 --> 00:18:22,862
He's too little for me.

304
00:18:22,863 --> 00:18:24,695
I didn't mean...

305
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:27,862
As heroes go, he is quite little.

306
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:30,278
I know you're brave.

307
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,238
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

308
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,153
So, if all goes well,

309
00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:42,446
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

310
00:18:43,988 --> 00:18:45,779
From everything you've
told me about her,

311
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,112
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

312
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:51,946
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

313
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,347
then she'd murder you.

314
00:18:54,488 --> 00:18:57,987
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

315
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,779
But if we go to the capital,

316
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,612
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

317
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:06,362
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

318
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,403
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

319
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:09,987
Of course she is.

320
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,278
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

321
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,737
Are we?

322
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,905
Laying any traps?

323
00:19:17,905 --> 00:19:21,237
If we want to create a
new and better world,

324
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:24,362
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

325
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,154
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

326
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,946
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

327
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:32,821
if you're going to win the throne.

328
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:34,862
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

329
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:37,237
But fear is all Cersei has.

330
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:40,071
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

331
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:41,987
It makes their power brittle

332
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:45,779
because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

333
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,320
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

334
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,987
He did.

335
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,612
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

336
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:54,071
Aegon built a wheel.

337
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,278
If that's the kind of
queen you want to be,

338
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,862
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

339
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:02,278
So we walk into the lions' den.

340
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,946
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip

341
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:05,570
on the Lannister forces.

342
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,445
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

343
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,737
Except yours.

344
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:12,862
And I promised him

345
00:20:12,863 --> 00:20:15,404
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

346
00:20:16,822 --> 00:20:18,222
Impulsive?

347
00:20:21,738 --> 00:20:24,445
This will be a difficult negotiation.

348
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:27,987
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

349
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:30,487
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

350
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:33,029
- And?
- And you have been known

351
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,195
to lose your temper from time to time,

352
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:36,529
as all great leaders do.

353
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,946
When have I lost my temper?

354
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,487
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

355
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:43,029
That was not impulsive.

356
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,862
That was necessary.

357
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:47,779
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

358
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,362
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

359
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:54,071
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

360
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:56,362
in the solitude of a cold cell.

361
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,779
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

362
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,821
before you ended their possibilities.

363
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:02,529
One could be forgiven for
thinking you're taking

364
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,362
your family's side in this debate.

365
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,195
I am taking their side.

366
00:21:06,196 --> 00:21:07,904
You need to take your enemy's side

367
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:09,904
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

368
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,862
And you need to see
things the way they do

369
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,904
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

370
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,237
respond effectively, and beat them.

371
00:21:17,238 --> 00:21:19,570
Which I want you to do very much.

372
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,071
Because I believe in you and in
the world you want to build.

373
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,737
But the world you want to build

374
00:21:25,738 --> 00:21:27,320
doesn't get built all at once.

375
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,445
Probably not in a single lifetime.

376
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:33,278
How do we ensure that
your vision endures?

377
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,238
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

378
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,112
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

379
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,513
Is that it?

380
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:46,862
You say you can't have children,

381
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:50,153
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

382
00:21:50,154 --> 00:21:52,278
The Night's Watch has one method.

383
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,654
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

384
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:57,362
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

385
00:21:57,363 --> 00:21:59,112
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

386
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:01,445
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

387
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,529
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

388
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,153
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

389
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:09,320
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

390
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:10,904
Is this one of the items you discussed

391
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,612
with your brother in King's Landing?

392
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:15,071
I'm trying to serve you by
planning for the long term.

393
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,654
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

394
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,696
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

395
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,988
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

396
00:23:04,696 --> 00:23:06,096
Look!

397
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:16,013
A bear.

398
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,030
Big fucker.

399
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,863
Do bears have blue eyes?

400
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,363
We have to get him back to Eastwatch.

401
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:39,096
Flask.

402
00:25:58,154 --> 00:25:59,554
Go on.

403
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,237
You all right?

404
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:20,987
I just got bit by a dead bear.

405
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:23,738
Aye, you did.

406
00:26:25,613 --> 00:26:27,530
Funny old life.

407
00:26:29,446 --> 00:26:31,278
Right, then.

408
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,196
We're off.

409
00:26:59,113 --> 00:27:02,320
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

410
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,446
She seems very resourceful.

411
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,529
You're worried.

412
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,195
We're asking 20,000 men

413
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,946
to fight with us in the worst
winter any of them have ever seen.

414
00:27:13,947 --> 00:27:16,946
The weather will be the
least of their problems.

415
00:27:16,947 --> 00:27:19,737
Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

416
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,237
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

417
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:25,862
Jon is not here. I haven't
heard from him in weeks.

418
00:27:25,863 --> 00:27:27,904
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

419
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:30,613
The king chose you to
rule in his absence.

420
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:34,403
And rule you have.

421
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,737
Wisely, ably.

422
00:27:37,738 --> 00:27:40,487
They see that. They respect you.

423
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:41,904
Some may even prefer you.

424
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:43,320
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

425
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:44,737
when it was time to retake Winterfell,

426
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:46,403
then they named him their king,

427
00:27:46,404 --> 00:27:48,278
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

428
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:50,529
How far would you trust men like that?

429
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,612
They're all bloody wind vanes.

430
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:54,654
If they found out that
I wrote that letter,

431
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:56,153
a woman who's already married

432
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:59,695
not one, but two enemies of her house...

433
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:02,737
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

434
00:28:02,738 --> 00:28:04,530
Arya's not like them.

435
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:08,362
She's your sister.

436
00:28:08,363 --> 00:28:10,153
You may have disagreements,

437
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:12,612
but she would never betray her family.

438
00:28:12,613 --> 00:28:15,153
She would if she thought I
was going to betray Jon.

439
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:17,071
Is that what she thinks?

440
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:18,987
I don't know what she thinks.

441
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,030
I don't know her anymore.

442
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,863
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

443
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:32,320
She's sworn to protect both
of Catelyn Stark's girls,

444
00:28:32,321 --> 00:28:33,721
is she not?

445
00:28:35,154 --> 00:28:36,571
She is.

446
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,904
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

447
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:47,030
wouldn't she be honor
bound to intercede?

448
00:28:50,072 --> 00:28:51,530
She would.

449
00:29:04,571 --> 00:29:07,987
- Something I've always wanted to know.
- All right.

450
00:29:07,988 --> 00:29:12,237
How drunk were you when you charged
through the breach on Pyke?

451
00:29:12,238 --> 00:29:16,030
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

452
00:29:17,905 --> 00:29:21,570
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

453
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:23,946
Sounded like a good scrap.

454
00:29:23,947 --> 00:29:26,237
Aye.

455
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:28,529
It was a proper scrap.

456
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,904
The ironborn thought you
were some kind of god,

457
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:34,238
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

458
00:29:35,613 --> 00:29:39,320
I thought you were the
bravest man I ever saw.

459
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,196
Just the drunkest.

460
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,403
Where's the rest of them?

461
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,655
If we wait long enough, we'll find out.

462
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,320
Run back to Eastwatch.

463
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:59,529
Get a raven to Daenerys,
tell her what's happened.

464
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:02,905
- I'm not leaving you.
- You're the fastest. Go, now.

465
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:06,821
You're faster without the hammer.
Give it.

466
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:08,222
Give it!

467
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,654
- Come on!
- Run!

468
00:33:18,655 --> 00:33:20,154
Come on!

469
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:28,196
Stop!

470
00:33:45,947 --> 00:33:47,347
Go!

471
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:36,987
What happened?

472
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:38,487
Where are the others?

473
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,695
Raven, we need to send a raven.

474
00:36:41,696 --> 00:36:43,488
Get the maester, now!

475
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:26,347
Thoros?

476
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:31,196
Thoros.

477
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:51,530
They say it's one of
the better ways to go.

478
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:10,071
Lord of Light, show us the way.

479
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:13,613
Come to us in our darkness and
lead Your servant into the light.

480
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,988
We have to burn his body.

481
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,403
We'll all be close behind him

482
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:30,279
unless the Lord of Light is kind
enough to send us a bit of fire.

483
00:38:39,321 --> 00:38:41,821
Lord of Light,

484
00:38:41,822 --> 00:38:44,487
come to us in our darkness,

485
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,196
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

486
00:39:11,113 --> 00:39:12,988
We'll all freeze soon.

487
00:39:14,196 --> 00:39:16,113
And so will the water.

488
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:22,821
When you killed the white walker,

489
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:26,695
almost all the dead
that followed it fell.

490
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:28,570
Why?

491
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:30,821
Maybe he was the one who turned them.

492
00:39:30,822 --> 00:39:34,195
We can go for the walkers.

493
00:39:34,196 --> 00:39:36,988
No.

494
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,321
We need to take that thing back with us.

495
00:39:44,488 --> 00:39:46,946
There's a raven flying
for Dragonstone now.

496
00:39:46,947 --> 00:39:50,362
Daenerys is our only chance.

497
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:53,321
No. There's another.

498
00:39:55,988 --> 00:39:57,388
Kill him.

499
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:00,196
He turned them all.

500
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,930
You don't understand.

501
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:09,112
The Lord brought you back.

502
00:40:09,113 --> 00:40:11,320
He brought me back.

503
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:14,403
No one else. Just us.

504
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:16,780
Did He do it to watch
us freeze to death?

505
00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:22,445
Careful, Beric. You lost your priest.

506
00:40:22,446 --> 00:40:24,237
This is your last life.

507
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:27,320
I've been waiting for the
end for a long time.

508
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,987
Maybe the Lord brought
me here to find it.

509
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:33,862
Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt.

510
00:40:33,863 --> 00:40:36,738
Don't see why the Lord of Light
should be any different.

511
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,347
My lady.

512
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:03,487
My lady?

513
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:07,613
It's an invitation to King's Landing.

514
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:15,946
My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.

515
00:41:15,947 --> 00:41:18,529
I am, and you will
represent my interests

516
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,112
at this gathering as you see them.

517
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:23,488
They invited you. They want you there.

518
00:41:24,988 --> 00:41:27,029
I will not set foot in King's Landing

519
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,612
while Cersei Lannister is queen.

520
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,320
If they want another Stark prisoner,

521
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:33,112
they can come and take me.

522
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:35,862
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

523
00:41:35,863 --> 00:41:37,779
I have work to do here.

524
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:42,403
It's not safe.

525
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:44,237
Ser Jaime will be there.

526
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:46,821
You said he treated
you honorably before.

527
00:41:46,822 --> 00:41:48,821
I'm not worried about me.

528
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:51,987
It's not safe leaving
you with Littlefinger.

529
00:41:51,988 --> 00:41:54,278
I have many guards who would happily

530
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:55,737
imprison him or behead him

531
00:41:55,738 --> 00:41:57,112
whether or not you're here.

532
00:41:57,113 --> 00:41:59,320
And you trust their loyalty?

533
00:41:59,321 --> 00:42:02,987
You trust he hasn't been speaking
to them all behind your back?

534
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:06,362
Let me at least leave Podrick
behind to watch over you.

535
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:07,987
He has become a competent swordsman...

536
00:42:07,988 --> 00:42:12,445
I do not need to be watched
over or minded or cared for.

537
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,695
I'm not a child,

538
00:42:13,696 --> 00:42:16,612
I am the Lady of
Winterfell, and I am home.

539
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:18,655
This is the safest place for me.

540
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:22,153
My lady,

541
00:42:22,154 --> 00:42:26,010
I swore an oath to protect you and
your sister. If I abandon you...

542
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:28,161
The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

543
00:42:28,196 --> 00:42:30,737
and you won't be traveling
on summer roads.

544
00:42:30,738 --> 00:42:33,863
The sooner you leave, the better
your chances of making it on time.

545
00:42:37,363 --> 00:42:38,763
Yes, my lady.

546
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,570
You can't.

547
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:05,445
The most important person in the world

548
00:43:05,446 --> 00:43:08,153
can't fly off to the most
dangerous place in the world.

549
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:10,195
- Who else can?
- No one.

550
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:12,195
They knew the risks when they left.

551
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:13,738
You can't win the throne if you're dead.

552
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:17,278
You can't break the
wheel if you're dead.

553
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:19,570
So, what would you have me do?

554
00:43:19,571 --> 00:43:21,362
Nothing.

555
00:43:21,363 --> 00:43:23,446
Sometimes nothing is the
hardest thing to do.

556
00:43:25,822 --> 00:43:29,238
If you die, we're all lost.

557
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:34,153
Everyone, everything.

558
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:37,821
You told me to do nothing
before and I listened to you.

559
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:39,613
I'm not doing nothing again.

560
00:44:36,321 --> 00:44:38,446
Dumb cunt.

561
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,030
Oh, fuck.

562
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,113
Fuck it.

563
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,013
Yah!

564
00:47:14,988 --> 00:47:16,388
Yah!

565
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:37,430
Fall back!

566
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:41,780
- Fall back!
- Come on!

567
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,946
Help me!

568
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:07,096
Go!

569
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,513
Jon!

570
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,278
Go!

571
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,780
Go now! Leave!

572
00:56:14,696 --> 00:56:16,654
Uncle Benjen!

573
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:18,055
How?

574
00:56:20,238 --> 00:56:22,987
- You ride for the pass.
- Come with me.

575
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:24,946
There's no time.

576
00:56:24,947 --> 00:56:26,822
Go!

577
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:43,112
We'll meet again, Clegane.

578
00:57:43,113 --> 00:57:45,446
Fucking hope not.

579
00:58:15,072 --> 00:58:17,279
It's time to go, Your Grace.

580
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:20,655
A bit longer.

581
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:46,530
Rider approaching!

582
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,237
Open the gate!

583
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:41,404
Not what you're looking for?

584
01:00:43,154 --> 01:00:46,571
I have hundreds of men here at
Winterfell, all loyal to me.

585
01:00:48,363 --> 01:00:50,072
They're not here now.

586
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:54,821
What are these?

587
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:56,238
My faces.

588
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,570
Where did you get them?

589
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:04,821
In Braavos, while I was
training to be a Faceless Man.

590
01:01:04,822 --> 01:01:06,988
What does that mean?

591
01:01:09,571 --> 01:01:11,487
Back in Braavos,

592
01:01:11,488 --> 01:01:14,153
before I got my first face,

593
01:01:14,154 --> 01:01:16,487
there was a game I used to play.

594
01:01:16,488 --> 01:01:18,695
The Game of Faces.

595
01:01:18,696 --> 01:01:20,487
It's simple...

596
01:01:20,488 --> 01:01:22,987
I ask you a question about yourself,

597
01:01:22,988 --> 01:01:26,403
and you try to make lies
sound like the truth.

598
01:01:26,404 --> 01:01:29,445
If you fool me, you win.

599
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:33,112
If I catch a lie, you lose.

600
01:01:33,113 --> 01:01:35,320
Let's play.

601
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:38,403
I don't want to play.

602
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:42,195
How do you feel about Jon being king?

603
01:01:42,196 --> 01:01:45,362
Is there someone else you think
should rule the North instead of him?

604
01:01:45,363 --> 01:01:49,278
Those faces, what are they?

605
01:01:49,279 --> 01:01:51,654
You want to do the asking?

606
01:01:51,655 --> 01:01:53,695
Are you sure?

607
01:01:53,696 --> 01:01:55,529
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

608
01:01:55,530 --> 01:01:57,278
for the last person who
asked me questions.

609
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:59,238
Tell me what they are.

610
01:02:02,363 --> 01:02:05,530
We both wanted to be other
people when we were younger.

611
01:02:06,696 --> 01:02:09,071
You wanted to be a queen,

612
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:12,363
to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

613
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:16,153
I wanted to be a knight,

614
01:02:16,154 --> 01:02:19,238
to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.

615
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:25,403
Neither of us got to be
that other person, did we?

616
01:02:25,404 --> 01:02:29,030
The world doesn't just let girls
decide what they're going to be.

617
01:02:30,404 --> 01:02:32,029
But I can now.

618
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:35,153
With the faces, I can choose.

619
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:37,446
I can become someone else.

620
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:41,237
Speak in their voice,

621
01:02:41,238 --> 01:02:42,863
live in their skin.

622
01:02:45,446 --> 01:02:48,072
I could even become you.

623
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:58,278
I wonder what it would feel like

624
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,446
to wear those pretty dresses...

625
01:03:02,238 --> 01:03:04,655
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

626
01:03:07,113 --> 01:03:09,446
All I'd need to find out...

627
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:12,971
is your face.

628
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:13,154
I'm sorry.

629
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:17,279
I'm so sorry.

630
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:31,154
I wish I could take it back.

631
01:04:33,196 --> 01:04:35,196
I wish we'd never gone.

632
01:04:38,696 --> 01:04:40,196
I don't.

633
01:04:41,863 --> 01:04:44,196
If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen.

634
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:48,154
You have to see it to know.

635
01:04:49,947 --> 01:04:51,530
Now I know.

636
01:04:54,905 --> 01:04:57,862
The dragons are my children.

637
01:04:57,863 --> 01:05:00,529
They're the only
children I'll ever have.

638
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,154
Do you understand?

639
01:05:07,947 --> 01:05:12,362
We are going to destroy the
Night King and his army.

640
01:05:12,363 --> 01:05:14,238
And we'll do it together.

641
01:05:16,154 --> 01:05:18,196
You have my word.

642
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:23,030
Thank you, Dany.

643
01:05:24,863 --> 01:05:26,237
"Dany"?

644
01:05:27,738 --> 01:05:29,905
Who was the last person
who called me that?

645
01:05:31,738 --> 01:05:34,570
I'm not sure. Was it my brother?

646
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:37,404
Mm, not the company you want to keep.

647
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:40,113
All right.

648
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:43,305
Not "Dany."

649
01:05:47,404 --> 01:05:49,404
How about "my queen"?

650
01:05:52,863 --> 01:05:56,237
I'd, uh, bend the knee, but...

651
01:05:56,238 --> 01:05:59,403
What about those who
swore allegiance to you?

652
01:05:59,404 --> 01:06:02,613
They'll all come to see
you for what you are.

653
01:06:18,446 --> 01:06:20,113
I hope I deserve it.

654
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:23,947
You do.

655
01:06:44,488 --> 01:06:46,154
You should get some rest.

656
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:53,000

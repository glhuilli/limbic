3
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,588
- Oil?
- Pitch, my lord.

4
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:57,131
- How many barrels?
- 500, my lord.

5
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:01,213
Get 500 more.

6
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,214
Yes, my lord.

7
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:17,630
I still enjoy it when
they call me "my lord."

8
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,088
The thrill will fade.

9
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:21,589
If we live that long.

10
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:24,797
Men without cocks.

11
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:26,505
You wouldn't find me fighting in an army

12
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,463
if I had no cock.

13
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:30,922
What's left to fight for?

14
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,797
Gold?

15
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:34,630
I spent my life around soldiers.

16
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,756
What do you think they
spend that gold on?

17
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:39,964
Family.

18
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,631
Not without a cock, you don't.

19
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:45,798
Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.

20
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:51,171
Yet, your brother has chosen
to side with the cockless.

21
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:56,046
Yes, he's always been a
champion of the downtrodden.

22
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:37,006
I think we're about to
be the downtrodden.

23
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:41,422
Archers, stand tall!

24
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:44,381
Cover that wall!

25
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,422
- How many people live here?
- A million, give or take.

26
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:19,547
That's more people than the
entire North crammed into that.

27
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:21,714
Why would anyone want to live that way?

28
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:24,171
There's more work in the city.

29
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:26,381
And the brothels are far superior.

30
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:06,755
Why isn't she with them?

31
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,922
I'm afraid I
don't know, Your Grace.

32
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,088
No one has seen her.

33
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,755
And the rest of them?

34
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:15,005
They're on their way
to the Dragonpit now.

35
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:16,297
Including our brother?

36
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:19,089
Yes, Your Grace.

37
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:24,922
If anything goes wrong,

38
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:26,964
kill the silver-haired bitch first,

39
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:30,255
then our brother, then the
bastard who calls himself king.

40
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,297
The rest of them you can kill
in any order you see fit.

41
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,088
Come, Ser Gregor.

42
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:38,256
It's time for us to meet our guests.

43
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,171
Why did they build it?

44
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:50,797
Dragons don't understand the difference

45
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:53,005
between what is theirs and what isn't.

46
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:56,672
Land, livestock, children...

47
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:59,213
Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.

48
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:03,005
I imagine it was a sad joke at the end.

49
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,463
An entire arena for a few sickly
creatures smaller than dogs.

50
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:09,964
But in the beginning, when it
was home to Balerion the Dread,

51
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:13,339
it must have been the most
dangerous place in the world.

52
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,673
Maybe it still is.

53
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:31,673
Welcome, my lords.

54
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,714
Your friends arrived before you did.

55
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:40,589
I've been sent to escort
you all to the meeting.

56
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:07,046
A pleasant surprise in
an unpleasant situation.

57
00:08:07,047 --> 00:08:09,714
I never thought I'd see
you again, my lord.

58
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:11,255
Supporting the enemy, no less.

59
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:14,006
- Hard to blame you.
- Cersei will anyway.

60
00:08:15,297 --> 00:08:16,714
I'm glad you're alive.

61
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:17,964
Come on!

62
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,423
You can suck his magic cock later.

63
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,464
What's in there?

64
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:31,256
Fuck off.

65
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,588
I thought you were dead.

66
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,755
Not yet.

67
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:47,089
You came pretty close.

68
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:51,047
I was only trying to protect her.

69
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:54,338
You and me both.

70
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:56,255
She's alive.

71
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:57,423
Arya.

72
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,297
- Where?
- Winterfell.

73
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:07,296
Who's protecting her if you're here?

74
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,797
The only one that needs protecting

75
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,131
is the one that gets in her way.

76
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:15,673
It won't be me.

77
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:20,880
Here we are...

78
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,422
the heroes of Blackwater Bay.

79
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:25,005
Strange place for a reunion.

80
00:09:25,006 --> 00:09:26,880
It is, my lord.

81
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,964
I don't think I'm anyone's
lord anymore, Podrick.

82
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:32,547
Save the titles for Ser
Bronn of the Blackwater.

83
00:09:32,548 --> 00:09:35,463
I'm sure your new queen will
be happy to restore yours

84
00:09:35,464 --> 00:09:36,922
if she ends up on the throne.

85
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:39,046
You've been thinking
about our new queen?

86
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:43,380
Perhaps you've been
reconsidering your allegiances.

87
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,422
Remember my offer...

88
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:48,839
whatever they're paying
you, I'll pay double.

89
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,380
And that would be double
what now, exactly?

90
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:53,922
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

91
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:56,255
- Looking after myself.
- Are you?

92
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,714
Helping me to arrange this meeting

93
00:09:57,715 --> 00:10:00,171
wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

94
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,964
You put yourself at risk.

95
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,839
I put yourself at risk.
Important difference.

96
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,338
It's your head Queen Cersei's offered
a bag of gold for, it's not mine.

97
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,130
Now, thanks to me,

98
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:13,338
she's got two traitors' heads
coming right through her door.

99
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:15,797
She can lop them both off
as soon as she gets tired

100
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:18,672
of the clever words that
pour out their pieholes.

101
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:21,880
All thanks to Ser Bronn of
the fucking Blackwater.

102
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:25,172
If that's not looking after
myself, I don't know what is.

103
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:28,214
It's good to see you again.

104
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,673
Yeah, you, too.

105
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:45,381
Anyone touches it, I'll kill you first.

106
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:45,046
Come on, Pod.

107
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:46,547
Let's you and me go have a drink

108
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:48,089
while the fancy folks talk, eh?

109
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:19,130
I left this shit city

110
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:21,964
because I didn't want to die in it.

111
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,256
Am I going to die in this shit city?

112
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:26,422
You might.

113
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:29,839
And this is all your idea.

114
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,171
Seems every bad idea has some
Lannister cunt behind it.

115
00:12:33,172 --> 00:12:36,338
And some Clegane cunt to
help them see it through.

116
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:38,046
Remember me?

117
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:39,964
Yeah, you do.

118
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:44,046
You're even fucking
uglier than I am now.

119
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,548
What did they do to you?

120
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,880
Doesn't matter.

121
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:52,088
That's not how it ends for you, brother.

122
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:55,338
You know who's coming for you.

123
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,423
You've always known.

124
00:14:11,965 --> 00:14:12,965
Where is she?

125
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:15,505
She'll be here soon.

126
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:16,756
Didn't travel with you?

127
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:19,631
No.

128
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,547
We've been here for some time.

129
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:18,840
My apologies.

130
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:29,797
We are all facing a unique...

131
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:31,839
Theon!

132
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,755
I have your sister.

133
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,172
If you don't submit to me here, now...

134
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:38,965
I'll kill her.

135
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:47,171
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

136
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,380
Then why are you talking?

137
00:16:49,381 --> 00:16:51,589
You're the smallest concern here.

138
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:55,839
Do you remember when we
discussed dwarf jokes?

139
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,588
His wasn't even good.

140
00:16:57,589 --> 00:16:58,922
He explained it at the end.

141
00:16:58,923 --> 00:17:00,463
Never explain. It always ruins it.

142
00:17:00,464 --> 00:17:01,964
We don't even let your kind live

143
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:05,171
in the Iron Islands, you know?

144
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:07,380
We kill you at birth.

145
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:09,422
An act of mercy for the parents.

146
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:12,088
Perhaps you ought to sit down.

147
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,547
Why?

148
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,756
Sit down or leave.

149
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:39,964
We are a group of people who
do not like one another,

150
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,506
as this recent demonstration has shown.

151
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,296
We have suffered at each other's hands.

152
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:49,672
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

153
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:51,964
If all we wanted was more of the same,

154
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:54,213
there would be no need
for this gathering.

155
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:57,255
We are entirely capable of
waging war against each other

156
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,964
without meeting face-to-face.

157
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:00,839
So instead, we should
settle our differences

158
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,505
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

159
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:04,922
We all know that will never happen.

160
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:06,297
Then why are we here?

161
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:11,673
This isn't about living in harmony.

162
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:14,964
It's just about living.

163
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,547
The same thing is coming for all of us.

164
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:19,588
A general you can't negotiate with.

165
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:23,338
An army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

166
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,922
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city.

167
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:30,338
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

168
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,047
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

169
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:38,631
This is serious.

170
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,797
I wouldn't be here if it weren't.

171
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:43,630
I don't think it's serious at all.

172
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:45,088
I think it's another bad joke.

173
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:47,839
If my brother Jaime has
informed me correctly,

174
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,463
you're asking me for a truce.

175
00:18:49,464 --> 00:18:52,006
Yes. That's all.

176
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,089
That's all?

177
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:58,046
Pull back my armies and stand down

178
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:59,755
while you go on your monster hunt.

179
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:02,338
Or while you solidify and
expand your position.

180
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:06,714
Hard for me to know which it
is with my armies pulled back

181
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:10,380
until you return and march on my
capital with four times the men.

182
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:14,715
Your capital will be safe until the
northern threat is dealt with.

183
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:17,422
You have my word.

184
00:19:17,423 --> 00:19:19,547
The word of a would-be usurper.

185
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:21,547
There is no conversation

186
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:25,588
that will erase the last 50 years.

187
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:27,798
We have something to show you.

188
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:45,881
We can destroy them by burning them.

189
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:58,881
And we can destroy
them with dragonglass.

190
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:02,714
If we don't win this fight,

191
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:06,715
then that is the fate of
every person in the world.

192
00:22:24,381 --> 00:22:26,588
There is only one war that matters...

193
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:28,923
the Great War.

194
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:31,423
And it is here.

195
00:22:35,631 --> 00:22:37,756
I didn't believe
it until I saw them.

196
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:41,423
I saw them all.

197
00:22:44,131 --> 00:22:45,338
How many?

198
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,756
A hundred thousand, at least.

199
00:23:03,506 --> 00:23:04,965
Can they swim?

200
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:07,255
No.

201
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:08,631
Good.

202
00:23:10,381 --> 00:23:13,130
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

203
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:15,213
What are you talking about?

204
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:17,130
I've been around the world.

205
00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:19,505
I've seen everything, things
you couldn't imagine,

206
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,965
and this...

207
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:26,756
this is the only thing I've
ever seen that terrifies me.

208
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,005
I'm going back to my island.

209
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:38,672
You should go back to yours.

210
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:40,630
When winter's over,

211
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:43,297
we'll be the only ones left alive.

212
00:23:52,756 --> 00:23:54,798
He's right to be afraid.

213
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:57,755
And a coward to run.

214
00:23:57,756 --> 00:24:00,005
If those things come for us,

215
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,922
there will be no kingdoms to rule.

216
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:04,338
Everything we suffered will
have been for nothing.

217
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,131
Everything we lost will
have been for nothing.

218
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,673
The crown accepts your truce.

219
00:24:13,006 --> 00:24:17,047
Until the dead are defeated,
they are the true enemy.

220
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,881
In return, the King in the
North will extend this truce.

221
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:33,088
He will remain in the
North where he belongs.

222
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:35,005
He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters.

223
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,422
He will not choose sides.

224
00:24:37,423 --> 00:24:39,714
Just the King in the North?

225
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:42,171
Not me?

226
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,797
I would never ask it of you.

227
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:46,380
You would never agree to it.

228
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:48,881
And if you did, I would trust
you even less than I do now.

229
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:53,130
I ask it only of Ned Stark's son.

230
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:56,673
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

231
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,630
I am true to my word.

232
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:15,381
Or I try to be.

233
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:21,089
That is why I cannot
give you what you ask.

234
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:25,089
I cannot serve two queens.

235
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:28,880
And I have already pledged myself

236
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:32,631
to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.

237
00:25:43,756 --> 00:25:46,338
Then there is nothing left to discuss.

238
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:49,338
The dead will come north first.
Enjoy dealing with them.

239
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,339
We will deal with
whatever is left of you.

240
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:01,463
Ser Jaime.

241
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:02,922
It's been good to see you.

242
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:04,922
I imagine the next time will
be across a battlefield.

243
00:26:04,923 --> 00:26:06,505
We both saw what just happened.

244
00:26:06,506 --> 00:26:08,255
We both saw that... thing.

245
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,046
Yes, and I'm not looking forward
to seeing more of them.

246
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,714
But I'm loyal to the queen,

247
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:14,630
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

248
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:16,755
Oh, fuck loyalty!

249
00:26:16,756 --> 00:26:18,296
Fuck loyalty?

250
00:26:18,297 --> 00:26:21,839
This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

251
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,339
Talk to the queen.

252
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,339
And tell her what?

253
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:42,840
I wish you hadn't done that.

254
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:50,005
I'm grateful for your loyalty,

255
00:26:50,006 --> 00:26:54,088
but my dragon died so
that we could be here.

256
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:56,505
If it's all for nothing,

257
00:26:56,506 --> 00:26:58,672
then he died for nothing.

258
00:26:58,673 --> 00:27:00,171
I know!

259
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:02,839
I'm pleased you bent
the knee to our queen.

260
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,547
I would have advised it, had you asked.

261
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:07,505
But have you ever considered

262
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:09,714
learning how to lie every now and then?

263
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:10,715
Just a bit?

264
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,089
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

265
00:27:16,464 --> 00:27:18,046
Talk about my father if you want,

266
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:21,130
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

267
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:24,213
But when enough people
make false promises,

268
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:27,380
words stop meaning anything.

269
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:30,547
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

270
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,296
And lies won't help us in this fight.

271
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:35,380
That is indeed a problem.

272
00:27:35,381 --> 00:27:38,923
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

273
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:41,547
Any ideas as to how we might

274
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:43,548
change that state of affairs?

275
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,380
Only one.

276
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,797
Everyone stays here,

277
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:51,588
and I go and talk to my sister.

278
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:56,005
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

279
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:57,797
I don't want Cersei to murder me either.

280
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:00,797
I could have stayed in my cell and
saved a great deal of trouble.

281
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:02,839
I did this.

282
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,338
- I should go.
- She'll definitely murder you.

283
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,715
I go see my sister alone.

284
00:28:10,214 --> 00:28:11,714
Or we all go home

285
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:13,464
and we're right back where we started.

286
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:19,672
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

287
00:29:19,673 --> 00:29:22,755
She thinks I was an idiot to trust you.

288
00:29:22,756 --> 00:29:24,880
A lot of people seem to
think that, actually.

289
00:29:24,881 --> 00:29:26,505
I'm about to step into a room

290
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:28,296
with the most murderous
woman in the world

291
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:32,213
who's already tried to kill
me twice, that I know of.

292
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:33,840
Who's an idiot?

293
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:39,714
I suppose we should say goodbye,

294
00:29:39,715 --> 00:29:41,297
one idiot to another.

295
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,130
I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose.

296
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,922
She's your kind of woman...

297
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:46,463
a foreign whore who
doesn't know her place.

298
00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:50,255
A foreign whore you can't
abduct, beat, or intimidate.

299
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:51,964
That must be difficult for you.

300
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:54,422
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

301
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:56,338
- whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

302
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:58,422
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

303
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,547
the goal you've worked
towards your entire life...

304
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:03,630
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- the destruction of this family.

305
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:06,964
I am the one preventing
that from happening.

306
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,505
Daenerys didn't want to
debate and negotiate.

307
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:10,964
She didn't want to bring you words.

308
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:12,922
She wanted to bring you fire and blood

309
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:15,046
until I advised her otherwise.

310
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,839
I don't want to destroy our family.

311
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,797
I never have.

312
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:20,255
You killed our father.

313
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:21,880
After he sentenced me to death

314
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,463
for a crime I didn't
commit, yes, I killed him.

315
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:26,130
Hate me for it if you want.

316
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:28,463
I hate myself for it in
spite of what he was,

317
00:31:28,464 --> 00:31:30,922
in spite of what he did to me.

318
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,672
Oh, poor little man.

319
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,380
Your papa was mean to you.

320
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:38,422
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

321
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:40,255
You left us open.

322
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:41,839
You laid us bare for the vultures,

323
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,380
and the vultures came and tore us apart.

324
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:47,046
You may not have killed Joffrey,

325
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:48,964
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

326
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:51,005
No one would've touched
them if Father was here.

327
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:53,588
- No one would have dared...
- I have never been more sorry about anything.

328
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:55,296
I will not hear it, not from you.

329
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:57,047
I will not hear it!

330
00:32:00,006 --> 00:32:02,338
All right.

331
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,797
You love your family,

332
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:06,880
and I have destroyed it.

333
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:09,630
I will always be a threat.

334
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:10,965
So put an end to me.

335
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:22,005
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

336
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,755
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

337
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:26,088
If it weren't for me,

338
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:28,171
you'd have two beautiful children.

339
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:30,338
I've thought about killing you

340
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:32,006
more times than I can count.

341
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:36,006
Do it! Say the word.

342
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:47,922
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.

343
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:51,088
- I will not...
- I don't care. I loved them.

344
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:52,964
You know I did.

345
00:33:52,965 --> 00:33:56,464
You know it in your heart if
there's anything left of it.

346
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,297
It doesn't matter.

347
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:05,880
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

348
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:08,046
I don't care why you did what you did.

349
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,922
I only care what it cost us.

350
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,297
It cost us our future.

351
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:16,088
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

352
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,088
Why did you allow me to come?

353
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,130
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

354
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:22,880
Yes, no, not what you hoped for,

355
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:25,423
but you must have hoped for something.

356
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,005
What did you hope for?

357
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:32,672
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

358
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:35,046
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

359
00:34:35,047 --> 00:34:36,797
- Yes.
- Why?

360
00:34:36,798 --> 00:34:38,380
Because I think

361
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:40,213
she will make the world a better place.

362
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:42,131
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.

363
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:46,255
She knows herself.

364
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:47,797
She chose an advisor

365
00:34:47,798 --> 00:34:51,130
who would check her worst
impulses instead of feeding them.

366
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,130
That's the difference between you.

367
00:34:53,131 --> 00:34:55,338
I don't care about checking
my worst impulses.

368
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:57,964
I don't care about making
the world a better place.

369
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,755
Hang the world.

370
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:02,213
That thing you dragged here,

371
00:35:02,214 --> 00:35:05,672
I know what it is, I know what it means.

372
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:07,880
And when it came at me, I
didn't think about the world.

373
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:09,964
Not at all.

374
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:11,547
As soon as it opened its mouth,

375
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:12,922
the world disappeared for me,

376
00:35:12,923 --> 00:35:15,046
right down its black throat.

377
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:17,422
All I could think about was
keeping those gnashing teeth

378
00:35:17,423 --> 00:35:18,964
away from the ones who matter most,

379
00:35:18,965 --> 00:35:20,755
away from my family.

380
00:35:20,756 --> 00:35:24,380
Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea.

381
00:35:24,381 --> 00:35:27,171
Get on a boat, take those who matter...

382
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,339
You're pregnant.

383
00:36:00,798 --> 00:36:03,505
No one is less happy
about this than I am.

384
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:04,923
I know.

385
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:10,088
I respect what you did.

386
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:12,423
Wish you hadn't done
it, but I respect it.

387
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:26,589
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

388
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:34,923
A dragon is not a slave.

389
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:40,213
They were terrifying.

390
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,923
Extraordinary.

391
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:46,380
They filled people with wonder and awe,

392
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:48,631
and we locked them in here.

393
00:36:49,923 --> 00:36:51,464
They wasted away.

394
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:54,964
They grew small.

395
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,589
And we grew small as well.

396
00:36:58,923 --> 00:37:01,505
We weren't extraordinary without them.

397
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:03,339
We were just like everyone else.

398
00:37:08,381 --> 00:37:10,297
You're not like everyone else.

399
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:18,631
And your family hasn't seen its end.

400
00:37:19,798 --> 00:37:21,422
You're still here.

401
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:23,964
I can't have children.

402
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:25,547
Who told you that?

403
00:37:25,548 --> 00:37:28,505
The witch who murdered my husband.

404
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:30,714
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

405
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,506
a reliable source of information?

406
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,463
You were right from the beginning.

407
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:43,673
If I had trusted you,
everything would be different.

408
00:37:47,756 --> 00:37:49,172
So, what now?

409
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:55,672
I can't forget what I
saw north of the Wall.

410
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,588
And I can't pretend that Cersei

411
00:37:57,589 --> 00:38:00,881
won't take back half the country
the moment I march north.

412
00:38:03,006 --> 00:38:05,506
It appears Tyrion's
assessment was correct.

413
00:38:07,923 --> 00:38:09,006
We're fucked.

414
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:04,256
My armies will not stand down.

415
00:39:05,715 --> 00:39:07,798
I will not pull them
back to the capital.

416
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:15,089
I will march them north to fight
alongside you in the Great War.

417
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:19,089
The darkness is coming for us all.

418
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:23,839
We'll face it together.

419
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,630
And when the Great War is over,

420
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,964
perhaps you'll remember I chose to help

421
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:33,423
with no promises or
assurances from any of you.

422
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:38,840
I expect not.

423
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,005
Call our banners.

424
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,506
All of them.

425
00:39:57,506 --> 00:40:00,755
It's not easy for
ravens to fly in these storms.

426
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:02,755
Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.

427
00:40:02,756 --> 00:40:06,171
No, this is the way he is,

428
00:40:06,172 --> 00:40:08,547
the way he's always been.

429
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:11,171
He never asked for my opinion.
Why would he start now?

430
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:14,922
I can't believe he'd surrender the
Northern crown without consulting you.

431
00:40:14,923 --> 00:40:17,338
This is his writing, his signature.

432
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:20,505
He pledged to fight for
Daenerys Targaryen.

433
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:22,588
He's bent the knee.

434
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:25,171
I've heard gossip

435
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:29,171
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

436
00:40:29,172 --> 00:40:31,381
What does that have to do with anything?

437
00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:36,422
Jon is young and unmarried.

438
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:38,630
Daenerys is young and unmarried.

439
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:41,588
You think he wants to marry her?

440
00:40:41,589 --> 00:40:44,839
An alliance makes sense.

441
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,047
Together, they'd be difficult to defeat.

442
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:51,673
He was named King in the North.

443
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,506
He can be unnamed.

444
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:02,005
Even if I wanted to, Arya
would never go along.

445
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,839
She always loved Jon far
more than she ever loved me,

446
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,046
and she'd kill anyone who
betrayed her family.

447
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,047
You are family, too.

448
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:14,630
Would Arya really murder her own sister?

449
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:16,964
Do you know what she is now?

450
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:20,338
Do you know what the Faceless Men are?

451
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,547
Only by reputation.

452
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:25,714
They worship the God
of Death, I believe.

453
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:28,338
I never trust godly men.

454
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:29,839
They're killers.

455
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,715
And Arya was one of them.

456
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:38,171
What do you think she's after?

457
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,755
She's your sister.

458
00:41:40,756 --> 00:41:42,881
You know her far better
than I ever could.

459
00:41:46,423 --> 00:41:51,171
Sometimes when I try to
understand a person's motives,

460
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:53,089
I play a little game.

461
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,589
I assume the worst.

462
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:03,422
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

463
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:08,380
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

464
00:42:08,381 --> 00:42:10,588
Then I ask myself,

465
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:13,755
"How well does that reason explain

466
00:42:13,756 --> 00:42:16,715
what they say and what they do?"

467
00:42:18,548 --> 00:42:20,088
So, tell me...

468
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:22,631
what's the worst thing she could want?

469
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,463
She could want me dead

470
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,672
because she thinks I wronged my family.

471
00:42:33,673 --> 00:42:35,965
Why did she come to Winterfell?

472
00:42:39,172 --> 00:42:41,130
To kill me

473
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:44,964
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

474
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:47,965
Why did she unearth the
letter Cersei made you write?

475
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:54,755
To provide proof of my betrayals.

476
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:59,505
To provide justification
after she murders me.

477
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:03,171
And after she murders you,

478
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:05,840
what does she become?

479
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,047
Lady of Winterfell.

480
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:31,005
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

481
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:33,672
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

482
00:43:33,673 --> 00:43:35,171
And the Unsullied?

483
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:36,797
We can sail with them to White Harbor,

484
00:43:36,798 --> 00:43:39,505
meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad,

485
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:42,463
then ride together to Winterfell.

486
00:43:42,464 --> 00:43:45,714
Perhaps you should fly to
Winterfell, Your Grace.

487
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:48,213
You have many enemies in the North.

488
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:50,463
Thousands fell fighting your father.

489
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:54,171
All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow.

490
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:56,380
He'll see your silver
hair on the kingsroad

491
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:59,422
and know that one well-placed
bolt will make him a hero.

492
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:02,047
The man who killed the conqueror.

493
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:05,380
It's your decision, Your Grace.

494
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:08,588
But if we're going to
be allies in this war,

495
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:12,672
it's important for the
Northerners to see us as allies.

496
00:44:12,673 --> 00:44:15,839
If we sail to White Harbor together,

497
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,089
I think it sends a better message.

498
00:44:24,548 --> 00:44:27,296
I've not come to conquer the North.

499
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,631
I'm coming to save the North.

500
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,589
We sail together.

501
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:52,756
Jon.

502
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:56,256
Can I speak with you?

503
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:00,715
All right.

504
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:09,171
What you did in King's Landing,

505
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:11,297
what you said...

506
00:45:13,464 --> 00:45:16,880
you could've lied to Cersei

507
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,798
about bending the knee to Daenerys.

508
00:45:23,798 --> 00:45:26,256
You risked everything to
tell an enemy the truth.

509
00:45:28,172 --> 00:45:30,630
We went down there to make peace.

510
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:34,130
And it seems to me we need
to be honest with each other

511
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,506
if we're going to fight together.

512
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:39,506
You've always known what was right.

513
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,296
Even when we were all young and stupid,

514
00:45:46,297 --> 00:45:47,797
you always knew.

515
00:45:47,798 --> 00:45:50,047
Every step you take...

516
00:45:51,506 --> 00:45:53,380
it's always the right step.

517
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,505
It's not.

518
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,755
It may seem that way from the outside,

519
00:45:56,756 --> 00:46:00,172
but I promise you, it's not true.

520
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:05,171
I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

521
00:46:05,172 --> 00:46:06,880
Not compared to me, you haven't.

522
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:08,506
No.

523
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:12,131
Not compared to you.

524
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:26,006
I always wanted to do the right thing.

525
00:46:28,673 --> 00:46:30,755
Be the right kind of person.

526
00:46:30,756 --> 00:46:33,339
But I never knew what that meant.

527
00:46:34,756 --> 00:46:37,089
It always seemed like there's...

528
00:46:41,172 --> 00:46:43,589
like there was an impossible
choice I had to make.

529
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:47,840
Stark or Greyjoy.

530
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:55,714
Our father was more of a father
to you than yours ever was.

531
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:58,547
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

532
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:00,422
Betrayed his memory.

533
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:01,423
I did.

534
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,172
But you never lost him.

535
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:14,131
He's a part of you.

536
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:17,422
Just like he's a part of me.

537
00:47:17,423 --> 00:47:19,589
But the things I've done...

538
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,047
It's not my place to
forgive you for all of it.

539
00:47:27,423 --> 00:47:30,630
But what I can forgive,

540
00:47:30,631 --> 00:47:32,047
I do.

541
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:40,589
You don't need to choose.

542
00:47:41,923 --> 00:47:43,881
You're a Greyjoy...

543
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:47,423
and you're a Stark.

544
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:04,046
When I was Ramsay's prisoner,

545
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:08,088
Yara tried to save me.

546
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:11,630
She's the only one

547
00:48:11,631 --> 00:48:13,589
who tried to save me.

548
00:48:20,673 --> 00:48:22,839
She needs me now.

549
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,631
So, why are you still talking to me?

550
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:41,338
Load up.

551
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:42,964
Load up, lads. Go on.

552
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:45,297
Tide's coming in.

553
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:04,006
All of us chose to follow Yara.

554
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:10,296
We left the Iron Islands for Yara.

555
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:13,131
She would never leave one of us behind.

556
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,714
We're not leaving her behind.

557
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:19,171
Your sister's dead.

558
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:20,880
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

559
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:23,755
Even if Euron hasn't cut her
throat yet, she's dead.

560
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:28,880
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister, and you left her to die.

561
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:30,381
I did.

562
00:49:32,756 --> 00:49:35,630
I ran from my uncle.

563
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:37,046
I was a coward.

564
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:40,296
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

565
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:43,922
They say the dead can't swim.

566
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:45,505
We're going to sail east,

567
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:47,880
find a nice, quiet island,

568
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,880
kill all the men, and take
their wives for ourselves.

569
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:53,296
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

570
00:49:53,297 --> 00:49:56,214
Yara did. She made a pledge.

571
00:49:58,131 --> 00:50:01,296
We're going to find her,

572
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:04,089
and we're going to set her free.

573
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:15,630
Run away, little Theon.

574
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:17,589
It's what you do best.

575
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:22,422
He needs to shut his mouth.

576
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:32,131
Hey!

577
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:38,380
Oh, yes!

578
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:41,131
That's more like it.

579
00:50:58,006 --> 00:50:59,006
Stay down...

580
00:51:00,256 --> 00:51:01,756
or I'll kill you!

581
00:51:12,297 --> 00:51:15,798
I said stay down or I'll kill you!

582
00:52:28,715 --> 00:52:30,381
Not for me.

583
00:52:33,673 --> 00:52:35,130
For Yara!

584
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:36,548
Yara!

585
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:24,589
Have my sister brought
to the Great Hall.

586
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,840
Are you sure you want to do this?

587
00:54:14,673 --> 00:54:17,922
It's not what I want.
It's what honor demands.

588
00:54:17,923 --> 00:54:20,839
And what does honor demand?

589
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,714
That I defend my family from
those who would harm us.

590
00:54:23,715 --> 00:54:27,339
That I defend the North from
those who would betray us.

591
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:31,297
All right, then.

592
00:54:32,715 --> 00:54:34,006
Get on with it.

593
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,005
You stand accused of murder.

594
00:54:39,006 --> 00:54:41,839
You stand accused of treason.

595
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,631
How do you answer these charges...

596
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:48,881
Lord Baelish?

597
00:55:04,631 --> 00:55:06,172
My sister asked you a question.

598
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:12,381
Lady Sansa, forgive me...

599
00:55:14,047 --> 00:55:15,839
I'm a bit confused.

600
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,130
Which charges confuse you?

601
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:20,171
Let's start with the simplest one...

602
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:22,755
you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn.

603
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:25,630
You pushed her through the Moon
Door and watched her fall.

604
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:27,506
Do you deny it?

605
00:55:29,548 --> 00:55:31,046
I did it to protect you.

606
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:33,088
You did it to take power in the Vale.

607
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:36,380
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

608
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:38,880
You gave Lysa Tears
of Lys to poison him.

609
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:39,923
Do you deny it?

610
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:45,422
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

611
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:47,756
she was a troubled woman.

612
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:50,380
She imagined enemies everywhere.

613
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:52,755
You had Aunt Lysa send a
letter to our parents

614
00:55:52,756 --> 00:55:55,255
telling them it was the
Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

615
00:55:55,256 --> 00:55:56,755
when, really, it was you.

616
00:55:56,756 --> 00:55:58,964
The conflict between the
Starks and the Lannisters,

617
00:55:58,965 --> 00:56:00,463
it was you who started it.

618
00:56:00,464 --> 00:56:01,547
Do you deny it?

619
00:56:01,548 --> 00:56:03,171
I know of no such letter.

620
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:05,005
You conspired with Cersei Lannister

621
00:56:05,006 --> 00:56:08,714
and Joffrey Baratheon to
betray our father, Ned Stark.

622
00:56:08,715 --> 00:56:11,255
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

623
00:56:11,256 --> 00:56:14,714
and later executed on
false charges of treason.

624
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:17,547
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

625
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:20,922
None of you were there
to see what happened.

626
00:56:20,923 --> 00:56:22,880
None of you knows the truth.

627
00:56:22,881 --> 00:56:24,798
You held a knife to his throat.

628
00:56:30,006 --> 00:56:32,631
You said, "I did warn
you not to trust me."

629
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:40,631
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

630
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,839
But that was another one of your lies.

631
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,673
It was yours.

632
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:53,714
Lady Sansa, I have known
you since you were a girl.

633
00:56:53,715 --> 00:56:56,380
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

634
00:56:56,381 --> 00:56:58,506
By selling me to the Boltons?

635
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,171
If we could speak alone,

636
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:03,715
I can explain everything.

637
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:09,046
Sometimes when I'm trying to
understand a person's motives,

638
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:11,630
I play a little game.

639
00:57:11,631 --> 00:57:13,297
I assume the worst.

640
00:57:14,673 --> 00:57:16,588
What's the worst reason you have

641
00:57:16,589 --> 00:57:18,506
for turning me against my sister?

642
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:22,422
That's what you do, isn't it?

643
00:57:22,423 --> 00:57:24,255
That's what you've always done...

644
00:57:24,256 --> 00:57:26,088
turn family against family,

645
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:28,005
turn sister against sister.

646
00:57:28,006 --> 00:57:30,213
That's what you did to our
mother and Aunt Lysa,

647
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,422
and that's what you tried to do to us.

648
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:33,755
Sansa, please.

649
00:57:33,756 --> 00:57:37,588
I'm a slow learner, it's true.

650
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:39,046
But I learn.

651
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:41,296
Give me a chance to defend myself.

652
00:57:41,297 --> 00:57:42,589
I deserve that.

653
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,005
I am Lord Protector of the Vale

654
00:57:50,006 --> 00:57:52,380
and I command you to escort
me safely back to the Eyrie.

655
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:53,673
I think not.

656
00:57:56,965 --> 00:57:59,673
Sansa, I beg you!

657
00:58:01,172 --> 00:58:03,213
I loved your mother since
the time I was a boy.

658
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:05,006
And yet, you betrayed her.

659
00:58:07,047 --> 00:58:10,213
I loved you.

660
00:58:10,214 --> 00:58:11,840
More than anyone.

661
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:14,756
And yet, you betrayed me.

662
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,130
When you brought me back to Winterfell,

663
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:21,672
you told me there's no
justice in the world,

664
00:58:21,673 --> 00:58:23,881
not unless we make it.

665
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:30,296
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish.

666
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:32,589
I will never forget them.

667
00:58:36,297 --> 00:58:37,297
Sansa!

668
00:58:44,297 --> 00:58:45,423
I...

669
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:09,964
Our men in King's Landing

670
00:59:09,965 --> 00:59:11,630
will march north in three days' time.

671
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,005
It'll take us a fortnight

672
00:59:13,006 --> 00:59:14,338
just to gather supplies for the train.

673
00:59:14,339 --> 00:59:15,880
We don't have a fortnight.

674
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:17,880
If the North falls, we fall. Three days.

675
00:59:17,881 --> 00:59:19,422
The remaining forces in the Westerlands

676
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,130
will take the river road east.

677
00:59:21,131 --> 00:59:22,672
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town

678
00:59:22,673 --> 00:59:24,672
and march together to Winterfell.

679
00:59:24,673 --> 00:59:25,840
Ser Jaime.

680
00:59:26,965 --> 00:59:28,338
Your Grace.

681
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:30,798
My lords, I need a
moment with my brother.

682
00:59:32,423 --> 00:59:34,256
Your Grace.

683
00:59:37,464 --> 00:59:41,296
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

684
00:59:41,297 --> 00:59:43,880
Expedition north?

685
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:47,171
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

686
00:59:47,172 --> 00:59:49,839
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

687
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,964
and you want to fight alongside them?

688
00:59:51,965 --> 00:59:53,922
Are you a traitor or an idiot?

689
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,880
You pledged our forces to
fight our common enemy...

690
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:57,338
I'll say whatever I need to say

691
00:59:57,339 --> 00:59:59,046
to ensure the survival of our house.

692
00:59:59,047 --> 01:00:01,797
You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father?

693
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,380
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

694
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:06,880
to fight for the Dragon Queen?

695
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:08,797
You saw it with your own eyes.

696
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:11,171
You saw a dead man trying to kill us.

697
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,005
I saw it burn.

698
01:00:13,006 --> 01:00:14,839
If dragons can't stop them,

699
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,880
if Dothraki and Unsullied and
Northmen can't stop them,

700
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:19,880
how will our armies make a difference?

701
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,880
This isn't about noble houses,

702
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:24,005
this is about the living and the dead!

703
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:26,046
And I intend to stay amongst the living.

704
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:29,255
Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the North.

705
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:31,463
We stay here where we've always been.

706
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:34,006
I made a promise.

707
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:39,588
Our child will rule Westeros.

708
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:44,463
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

709
01:00:44,464 --> 01:00:46,046
The monsters are real.

710
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:48,171
The white walkers,

711
01:00:48,172 --> 01:00:50,422
the dragons, the Dothraki screamers...

712
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:54,422
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

713
01:00:54,423 --> 01:00:56,130
So be it.

714
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:58,255
Let the monsters kill each other.

715
01:00:58,256 --> 01:01:00,505
And while they battle in the North,

716
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:02,922
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

717
01:01:02,923 --> 01:01:05,714
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

718
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:08,630
When the fighting in the
North is over, someone wins.

719
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:10,797
You understand that, don't you?

720
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,296
If the dead win, they march
south and kill us all.

721
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:17,380
If the living win, and
we've betrayed them,

722
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:19,338
they march south and kill us all!

723
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:22,338
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

724
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:23,755
Most of them will die in the North.

725
01:01:23,756 --> 01:01:25,338
I faced them in the field.

726
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:27,880
We can't beat them. We
can't beat their dragons.

727
01:01:27,881 --> 01:01:29,422
How many dragons did you see at the pit?

728
01:01:29,423 --> 01:01:31,422
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

729
01:01:31,423 --> 01:01:33,922
For all we know, it's
guarding her fleet!

730
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:37,255
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

731
01:01:37,256 --> 01:01:40,046
She came here to show us all her power.

732
01:01:40,047 --> 01:01:43,088
No, something happened. The
dragons are vulnerable.

733
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:45,630
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

734
01:01:45,631 --> 01:01:47,463
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

735
01:01:47,464 --> 01:01:50,131
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

736
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:56,088
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

737
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:58,255
Oh, I know it's boring for you.

738
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:01,880
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

739
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,463
But I listened, I learned.

740
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:08,463
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos...

741
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:10,255
the Golden Company.

742
01:02:10,256 --> 01:02:13,964
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

743
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:15,630
The Golden Company is not here.

744
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:17,005
They're in Essos.

745
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:20,964
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

746
01:02:20,965 --> 01:02:23,463
Do you really think Euron
Greyjoy turned tail

747
01:02:23,464 --> 01:02:25,089
and sailed back to the Iron Islands?

748
01:02:26,214 --> 01:02:27,588
Do you think he abandoned

749
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:30,839
the chance to marry the queen?

750
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,172
No one walks away from me.

751
01:02:35,006 --> 01:02:36,672
He's sailing with his fleet to Essos.

752
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:38,755
He's going to ferry the
Golden Company back here

753
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:40,297
to help us win the war for Westeros.

754
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,005
You plotted with Euron
Greyjoy without telling me,

755
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:47,839
the commander of your armies?

756
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,463
And you conspired with Tyrion,

757
01:02:50,464 --> 01:02:51,839
the man who murdered our father,

758
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,171
without telling me, your queen.

759
01:02:53,172 --> 01:02:54,630
I didn't conspire with him.

760
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:56,505
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

761
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,505
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

762
01:02:58,506 --> 01:03:00,797
That is the definition of conspiracy.

763
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:03,171
I pledged to ride north.

764
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:05,005
I intend to honor that pledge.

765
01:03:05,006 --> 01:03:07,213
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

766
01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:09,463
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

767
01:03:09,464 --> 01:03:10,798
What would you call it?

768
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:14,673
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.

769
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,381
I told you no one walks away from me.

770
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:29,256
Are you going to order him to kill me?

771
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:33,338
I'm the only one you have left.

772
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:35,797
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

773
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:37,547
It's just me and you now.

774
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,548
There's one more yet to come.

775
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:44,548
Give the order, then.

776
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,631
I don't believe you.

777
01:05:53,548 --> 01:05:56,047
Come in.

778
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:01,505
Samwell Tarly.

779
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:03,714
I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.

780
01:06:03,715 --> 01:06:05,548
I remember everything.

781
01:06:13,715 --> 01:06:15,880
You helped us get beyond the Wall.

782
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:18,422
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

783
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:21,047
but, um, I'm not sure that I am.

784
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,381
What happened to you beyond the Wall?

785
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,381
I became the Three-Eyed Raven.

786
01:06:32,006 --> 01:06:33,089
Oh!

787
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:38,755
I don't know what that means.

788
01:06:38,756 --> 01:06:41,505
I can see things that
happened in the past.

789
01:06:41,506 --> 01:06:45,588
I can see things happening now

790
01:06:45,589 --> 01:06:47,089
all over the world.

791
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,923
Why did you come to Winterfell?

792
01:06:52,214 --> 01:06:53,589
Um...

793
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:57,964
Jon's the one to lead the
fight against the dead.

794
01:06:57,965 --> 01:07:00,046
I know he is.

795
01:07:00,047 --> 01:07:02,005
But he can't do it alone,

796
01:07:02,006 --> 01:07:04,880
so I've come here to help him.

797
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:07,755
He's on his way back to Winterfell

798
01:07:07,756 --> 01:07:09,381
with Daenerys Targaryen.

799
01:07:10,548 --> 01:07:13,588
You... you saw this in...

800
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:15,256
in a vision?

801
01:07:18,256 --> 01:07:19,464
Oh.

802
01:07:22,256 --> 01:07:24,464
He needs to know the truth.

803
01:07:25,715 --> 01:07:27,005
The truth about what?

804
01:07:27,006 --> 01:07:28,797
About himself.

805
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,338
No one knows. No one but me.

806
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,296
Jon isn't really my father's son.

807
01:07:35,297 --> 01:07:39,463
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

808
01:07:39,464 --> 01:07:43,296
He was born in a tower in Dorne.

809
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:45,755
His last name isn't really Snow,

810
01:07:45,756 --> 01:07:46,756
it's Sand.

811
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:50,131
It's not.

812
01:07:51,715 --> 01:07:54,130
Dornish bastards are named Sand.

813
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:57,755
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

814
01:07:57,756 --> 01:08:00,506
He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia.

815
01:08:02,297 --> 01:08:05,214
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

816
01:08:06,506 --> 01:08:07,964
Are you certain?

817
01:08:07,965 --> 01:08:10,672
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

818
01:08:10,673 --> 01:08:12,506
I don't know why he'd lie.

819
01:08:14,339 --> 01:08:16,881
Is this something you can see?

820
01:08:18,339 --> 01:08:22,171
Father, Smith, Warrior,

821
01:08:22,172 --> 01:08:27,046
Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger.

822
01:08:27,047 --> 01:08:30,839
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

823
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:35,171
from this day until the end of my days.

824
01:08:35,172 --> 01:08:38,297
Robert's
Rebellion was built on a lie.

825
01:08:40,423 --> 01:08:43,548
Rhaegar didn't kidnap
my aunt or rape her.

826
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:54,673
He loved her.

827
01:09:02,423 --> 01:09:04,047
And she loved him.

828
01:09:30,464 --> 01:09:33,423
And Jon...

829
01:09:35,464 --> 01:09:37,256
Jon's real name...

830
01:09:39,256 --> 01:09:43,588
His name is Aegon Targaryen.

831
01:09:43,589 --> 01:09:45,798
You have to protect him.

832
01:09:47,297 --> 01:09:49,214
Promise me, Ned.

833
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:14,297
He's never been a bastard.

834
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,923
He's the
heir to the Iron Throne.

835
01:10:35,756 --> 01:10:37,464
He needs to know.

836
01:10:40,673 --> 01:10:42,464
We need to tell him.

837
01:10:52,798 --> 01:10:55,505
Are you all right?

838
01:10:55,506 --> 01:10:57,422
It's just strange.

839
01:10:57,423 --> 01:11:01,381
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

840
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:06,880
You did the right thing.

841
01:11:06,881 --> 01:11:09,422
You did it.

842
01:11:09,423 --> 01:11:11,255
I'm just the executioner.

843
01:11:11,256 --> 01:11:13,006
You passed the sentence.

844
01:11:15,172 --> 01:11:18,005
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

845
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:19,381
Does that bother you?

846
01:11:21,965 --> 01:11:24,840
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

847
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:27,798
So I had to be something else.

848
01:11:30,006 --> 01:11:32,755
I never could have survived
what you survived.

849
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:35,088
You would have.

850
01:11:35,089 --> 01:11:37,089
You're the strongest person I know.

851
01:11:41,172 --> 01:11:43,715
I believe that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

852
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:49,088
Well, don't get used to it.

853
01:11:49,089 --> 01:11:51,339
You're still very strange and annoying.

854
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,840
"In winter, we must protect ourselves.

855
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:03,423
Look after one another."

856
01:12:05,548 --> 01:12:07,256
Father.

857
01:12:10,381 --> 01:12:14,547
"When the snows fall and
the white winds blow,

858
01:12:14,548 --> 01:12:16,505
the lone wolf dies,

859
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:18,965
but the pack survives."

860
01:12:25,965 --> 01:12:27,256
I miss him.

861
01:12:30,589 --> 01:12:32,089
Me, too.

862
01:13:53,715 --> 01:13:55,839
It's a long way down.

863
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:59,673
Yeah. The crows keep telling
me I'll get used to it.

864
01:14:08,423 --> 01:14:11,463
I can see movement...

865
01:14:11,464 --> 01:14:14,172
Watch, on the tree line!

866
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:17,005
What is it?

867
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:49,862
Come on!

868
01:15:50,506 --> 01:15:53,706
Run! Run!

869
01:18:28,985 --> 01:18:38,303

    "This notebook is built with the purpose of creating a large corpus to train and test a machine learning emotions classifier for the `limbic` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that currently the `limbic` package supports a very deterministic dictionary-based emotions classification, the idea is the following: \n",
    "1. Fetch a large corpus of texts. These texts need to have a wide range of emotions depicted inside. It's impossible to manually review for a reasonably distributed set of emotions in this corpus, so as a strong assumption I'll be picking as many books from different genres as I can. The hypothesis is that with a large enough set of large documents, the classifier will be able to pick the patterns on which emotions \n",
    "2. Pre-process such texts in order to isolate as many sentences as possible and run the current emotions classifier on each sentence. \n",
    "3. Aggregate such results to create a multi-category dataset where each sentence will be associated to many categories, and each category will have a strength as determined by the dictionary-based emotions classifier in `limbic`.\n",
    "4. Train a model using such dataset and then check the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, I picked a few books from https://www.smashwords.com/ that were free and their `txt` version was already available. This is just to get started, but this collection of cheesy fiction books from different genres which seem to be quite heavy on emotions so it might be a good sample (added a few non-fiction factual books to balance out too many emotions for the classifier). Also, I went throught the classic Guthemberg project and picked ~90 books from the top list https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top . The model will be built in TensorFlow using a bi-directional recurrent neural network for multi-label classification, and tested in a separate notebook. \n",
